player,team,position,scouting_report
Leo Carlsson,Anaheim Ducks,Forward,"A developing two-way forward who has already shown a balanced and efficient skillset. Focuses on creating offence in the slot, he takes and setting up very few shots from the perimeter and using his skating and handling ability to transports the puck to dangerous areas of the ice. A crafty and creative player with the puck on his stick, where he makes quality plays in transition, uses his hands to take on defenders one-on-one, and rarely turns over the puck, and without it where he cleanly steals it from opponents. Not a checker despite his size and still a bit timid to get involved physically on the boards, but not afraid to go to the net."
Robby Fabbri,Anaheim Ducks,Forward,"A complementary depthwinger who gets to the net and scores with some efficiency but otherwise exerts a limited impact on the game. Skating and turnovers are an issue, and while he shows flashes of skill with the puck he spends very little time with it on his stick. Offers a bit of physicality and forechecking but plays a very slow game and has struggled defensively throughout his career."
Alex Killorn,Anaheim Ducks,Forward,"A veteran utility winger who can kill penalties and do some of the hard work in the defensive zone while putting the puck in the net at a solid rate. Not exactly speedy at this point in his career, but maintains solid offensive instincts and skills that make him a reasonable complementary piece on either wing."
Chris Kreider,Anaheim Ducks,Forward,"A veteran scoring winger who terrorizes goalies in the front of the net with deflections, rebounds, and other shots from the inner slot. Separates himself from other crease crashers and screeners with a strong finishing touch and great mobility which allows him to be a threat to score and distribute the puck in transition as well -- not a lot of guys who play the way he does get as many breakaways. Nonetheless spends relatively little time with the puck on his stick, and as his skating declines the powerplay will likely be even more of a core part of his production than it is now."
Brock McGinn,Anaheim Ducks,Forward,A veteran fourth line winger who can be a speedy puck retriever without the puck but offers limited value with it. Willing to play a simple dump-and-chase game in transition and get to the net but not particularly creative outside of a defensive role.
Mason McTavish,Anaheim Ducks,Forward,"A developing shoot-first net-front player who uses his strong frame to gain position and jump on rebounds in the slot. Produces well and flashes high-end skill with small area plays but not yet having the overall impact on the game expected of his junior career, particularly defensively and along the boards where he hasn’t been able to assert himself. A low-workload transition player who prefers to carry the puck than pass it and must learn to overcome slow speed."
Ryan Strome,Anaheim Ducks,Forward,"A veteran playmaking winger whose effectiveness outside of creating opportunities for his linemates has diminished significantly. An average finisher who doesn’t shoot the puck much, a questionable defender despite often playing centre, one of the slowest skaters in the league, and a constant committer of stick infractions, his passing ability is rapidly getting overshadowed."
Troy Terry,Anaheim Ducks,Forward,"A creative dangling winger whose love of carrying the puck in transition and challenging defenders one-on-one is matched only by his absolute disinterest in throwing body-checks. Dominant with the puck on his stick at 5-on-5 and deadly off the rush, he’s showed tremendous upside as a scoring-chance creator but has been more sizzle than steak in the past two seasons. That said, his solid puck management and possession game combined with a near-league-best penalty differential pay strong dividends for the Ducks."
Frank Vatrano,Anaheim Ducks,Forward,"A middle-six scoring winger with strong physicality and skating. One-dimensional offensively, shooting the puck from the outer slot at a high frequency (often off the counter-attack) and finishing well too. Decent at separating opponents from the puck and can use his speed to chase hits, but otherwise uninvolved without the puck and not much of a battler or forechecker."
Radko Gudas,Anaheim Ducks,Defence,"A physical beast of a defensive defenceman who protects the front of the net and throws devastating body checks (often with questionable legality) with relish and great frequency. Happy to stand up opposing forwards entering the zone. Much more limited offensively, and while he can toss out the odd stretch pass his impact in transition is usually limited to chipping pucks off the glass. Possesses one of the hardest slap shots in the game and uses it often; adventures deeper in the offensive zone than the point are much rarer."
Jackson LaCombe,Anaheim Ducks,Defence,"A top-pairing two-way defenceman who makes a big impact on the game with his mobility, puck skills, and aggressive style of play. An opportunistic player in all three zones who wants to get involved and make a big, difference-making play, and has learned how to execute at a high level. Sees the ice incredibly well on the break-out, identifying options and equally capable of advancing the puck himself or delivering a clean build-up or stretch pass. Won’t hesitate to jump up in the play but moves around well enough to give linemates the option to hit him with a pass in the neutral zone without taking himself too far out of position and leaving his partner vulnerable. Plays a suffocatingly tight gap on the rush and focuses on killing plays early, using his feet, stick, and body in tandem to take away time and space. He’s a proactive defender whose speed allows him to close out quickly and also recover when things go badly, which mitigates the risks of the plays he makes with and without the puck. His solid build makes him no slouch in front of the net and helps him win 50/50 puck retrievals with frequency. Adjustments since his days as an NCAA prospect have blown his ceiling wide open, and he has legitimate high-end #1 defenceman potential having already shown he can hold up in heavy and difficult deployment."
Jacob Trouba,Anaheim Ducks,Defence,"A veteran checking offensive defenceman whose punishing and often borderline legal bodychecks have increasingly become the focal point of his game. Diminishing mobility and his eagerness to intimidate opponents have added up to a recklessness in his defensive game where chasing hits frequently means vacating important real estate closer to the net. When his shoulder (or elbow) connects with a rushing forward it can be devastating, but the uncomfortable truth is that few defenders get walked around with the frequency that he does and his ability to defend his blueline is deteriorating rapidly. Offensively he’s willing to join the rush and has a knack for shooting for deflections and targeting open sticks in the slot, but his own shooting efficiency is poor."
Pavel Mintyukov,Anaheim Ducks,Defence,"A developing offensive defenceman who showed plenty of skill with the puck on his stick, particularly when dishing it to rushing forwards or finding linemates in dangerous areas within the offensive zone. Had a relatively low workload in transition but made clean and successful plays maintaining possession when called upon. Struggled defensively but showed a willingness to engage physically and battle for the puck despite below-average size."
Morgan Geekie,Boston Bruins,Forward,"A hard-working utility winger with some playmaking skill in transition. Not a speedy skater but works hard in the corners and makes life unpleasant for opposing defenders. Gets to the net to deflect pucks but doesn’t create a high volume of scoring chances. Can move up and down the lineup, playing a simple game alongside skilled players or bottom six grinders."
Elias Lindholm,Boston Bruins,Forward,"A complementary scoring centre. At his best, provides a stabilizing defensive presence and fills in the blanks when playing with skilled linemates while contributing in all situations. Doesn’t require a lot of time with the puck to contribute, just gets to the middle of the ice and gets open for one-time passes or to jump on rebounds and loose pucks in tight. The style gives him a high scoring upside when playing with talented linemates but gives him a low floor as well as he’s very limited in terms of what he can do on his own. Manages the puck efficiently and is a reasonably good passer but shouldn’t be expected to drive his own line."
Casey Mittelstadt,Boston Bruins,Forward,"A playmaking middle-six two-way centre. Flashes high-end upside as a playmaker, making tape-to-tape passes directly into the slot and using saucer passes to slip them through traffic. Doesn’t tend to shoot the puck unless he absolutely has to, usually right at the net-mouth. Moves the puck up-ice with possession whenever possible, making him an effective play-driving centre, and has improved his defensive game in part by increasingly avoiding risky one-on-one deke attempts that were previously a fixture of his game."
David Pastrnak,Boston Bruins,Forward,"An elite scoring winger who plays the game with almost unmatched flair and creativity. His trademark is his almost unparalleled wrist shot from the top of the circle, which has terrorized goaltenders throughout his career, but he’s also got a terrific one-timer and a superb set of hands which he uses both to create shooting space and undress opponents. Combined with decent wheels and size, this allows him to navigate the neutral zone and challenge defenders one-on-one more than anybody else in the league. Admittedly, this ambition does come at a cost and those attempts to take the tough road to the net fail at a high rate and lead to a lot of turnovers. Nonetheless, he’s an adequate defender and willing to put in the work in his own end to counter-act them. An efficient passer who totally neglects the perimeter and focuses on targeting the slot, perhaps reasoning that anyone he sets up on the outside has a lower chance of scoring there than he does."
Pavel Zacha,Boston Bruins,Forward,"A playmaking utility forward who manages the puck carefully and prefers to make the simple feed to his linemates than do anything too ambitious with it himself both in transition and the offensive zone. Not a driver by any stretch but gets where he needs to be, whether deflecting pucks at the net-mouth or one-timing pucks in the top of the slot. Active in the defensive zone retrieving loose pucks and turning them into zone exits and kills penalties, but an inconsistent defender at even strength."
Hampus Lindholm,Boston Bruins,Defence,"A smooth-skating top-pairing two-way defender who dishes out crisp break-out passes. Equally comfortable moving the puck up-ice or carrying it through the neutral zone himself. Sees the ice well in the offensive zone, swinging the puck around the perimeter or pushing deeper into the zone to create more dangerous opportunities. Uses his mobility and an active defensive stick to force opponents to dump the puck, disrupt plays, block passing lanes, and retrieve loose pucks at high rates. Can tend to try to force the issue at both ends, occasionally chasing the play when caught in the zone on defence and taking penalties (despite rarely throwing hits) and turning the puck over."
Charlie McAvoy,Boston Bruins,Defence,"An #1 two-way defenceman who is ambitious with the puck but executes at an extremely high level. A well-rounded player who moves the puck in all three zones with accuracy whether he’s launching a stretch pass from his own end, setting up a rushing forward in the neutral zone, or teeing up linemates with one-time feeds or high-danger passes in tight. A strong puck-carrier who moves up the ice quickly and rarely makes a false move in transition, starting with a knack for turning loose pucks in the defensive zone into clean exits with possession. This balanced skillset has made him one of the game’s premier drivers from the blueline. Quick to recognize and exploit any opportunity to jump up in the play, foregoing low-percentage point shots in favour of receiving passes and carrying it closer to the net for a scoring chances. Has exceptional hands and isn’t afraid to take on other defenders one-on-one, resulting on occasion in highlight reel goals. Solidly built and capable of throwing punishing body-checks."
Nikita Zadorov,Boston Bruins,Defence,"A huge and physical defence-first blue-liner. Envious physical tools include a heavy slap shot and high-end straight line skating speed. Builds up momentum carrying the puck through the neutral zone, using his hands (and stick length) to weave through opponents. Makes a solid breakout pass too and while he almost always thinks shoot-first in the offensive zone he set ups chances off the rush as well while generally avoiding turnovers. Aggressiveness and stick are mostly assets defensively, although he can at times get walked around and isn’t as agile as he is fast. When chasing the play often crosses the line of legality and gets his stick tangled up, and rarely gets the benefit of the doubt."
Zach Benson,Buffalo Sabres,Forward,"A developing playmaking winger. Despite his small size and lack of foot speed, willing to engage along the boards and pressure opposing defenders on the forecheck and has shown high defensive upside. A high-IQ passer who makes the most of his time with the puck, making controlled plays in transition and tilting the ice effectively. Taking the next step will require improving skating and getting more touches offensively."
Peyton Krebs,Buffalo Sabres,Forward,"A playmaking defensive centre who has found himself stuck in a depth role due to difficulty asserting himself offensively. Willing to do the physical work to keep play along the boards and away from his goal and separates opponents from pucks at a strong rate, but is not a threat to shoot or score and hasn’t established himself as a top-six quality passer either."
Ryan McLeod,Buffalo Sabres,Forward,"A two-way centre who is one of the fastest skaters in the sport and uses it to win races to the puck all over the ice. Forces opposing defenders to back off off the rush and enters the zone with possession at a high rate. While he has good hands, he’s still working out how best to take advantage of the space he creates, although he has taken significant strides as a playmaker  A prolific puck thief who rarely turns the puck over himself and is an elite penalty killer. Average in the dot."
Josh Norris,Buffalo Sabres,Forward,"An efficient scoring centre with the tools to be more than that. Not a volume shooter at all, but converts on his chances at a consistently high rate due in part to his selectiveness. On the powerplay, he’s a major one-time option, although it remains to be seen whether the ability to overpower goaltenders with shots from the circle can return after three shoulder surgeries; for now, he’s made up for that by venturing closer to the cage and tapping in passes instead. At even strength, he has a tricky shot that he prefers to keep along the ice but does a lot of his damage on net-front deflections instead of perimeter snipes. Passing has never been a forté of his and most of his feeds are to the point. The rest of his tool-kit is above-average: he’s got breakaway footspeed, a strong defensive stick, solid physicality, and a willingness to block shots. Ideally with fewer interruptions from injury, all of this will come together to make him the high-end two-way centre he seemed primed to be as a rookie."
Jack Quinn,Buffalo Sabres,Forward,"A developing dynamic scoring winger who shows creativity with the puck, manipulates defenders with timing, and can put the puck in the net from anywhere. A shoot-first player who gets open in the outer slot for one-timers but a crafty passer as well off the rush. Defence is a work in progress, but stays above-water and kills penalties."
Tage Thompson,Buffalo Sabres,Forward,"A star scoring centre with a unique blend of size, hands, and finishing touch. Torments opposing defenders on the rush by drawing them in and then deking past them with his long stick, but if they leave him any space in the middle of the ice they risk exposing their goaltender to one of the best shots in hockey. Has shown upside as a playmaker but will always be a shoot-first player. Has a powerful skating stride despite his length. Performs best when kept away from traditional power-forward role along the boards and allowed to wait for the puck to come to him from forechecking wingers as opposed to chasing it down himself; unfortunately, needing to play centre exposes his near-league-worst faceoff ability."
Alex Tuch,Buffalo Sabres,Forward,"A playmaking top six winger who generates most of his offence off the rush. A quick skater who’s willing to crash the net for rebounds, he doesn’t throw the body but uses his 6”4 frame to win pucks and get to dangerous areas of the ice. Moves the puck up the ice swiftly in transition and finds open teammates in the slot. Defensive impact is less consistent but at his best he’s a committed forechecker and possession driver."
Jason Zucker,Buffalo Sabres,Forward,A veteran scoring winger who despite having lost the separating speed that made him a top-line sniper in his prime remains a solid creator of chances and goals when paired with a talented playmaker. Possesses a great one-timer from the outer slot but also willing to go to the net where he has good hands and finishing touch. Less of a factor defensively but brings a bit of physicality.
Rasmus Dahlin,Buffalo Sabres,Defence,"A star two-way left defenceman with elite puck skills, including exceptional ability to transport the puck from his own zone to the offensive zone using both his deceptive skating and passing ability. Once set up, controls play in the offensive zone, walking the line and distributing the puck from the point, pushing deeper towards the slot to get dangerous chances himself, or using his bomb of a point shot. An underrated defender who aggressively kills plays with terrific stick-checks, closes passing lanes, and actively retrieves loose pucks to get the break-out started. Contributes some physicality, but despite his agility lacks straight-line footspeed and takes more holding and hooking penalties than he ought to."
Owen Power,Buffalo Sabres,Defence,"A developing two-way puck-moving left defenceman who despite his size plays a cerebral game closer to the likes of Adam Fox than Chris Pronger. Takes almost no slap shots or one-timer point shots, preferring to carry the puck deeper into the offensive zone or distribute it to his defensive partner. Very active in transition; few defencemen pass the puck out of the defensive zone or carry it into the offensive zone with as much frequency. That process starts with a heavy workload in his own end, where Power has a long and effective stick and frequently chases pucks along the wall despite rarely throwing body checks. Despite a low top skating speed, moves efficiently up the ice and joins the rush. Can tend to be a bit soft in his own zone, losing battles for position that he should be dominating given his size and practically never throwing the body."
Bowen Byram,Buffalo Sabres,Defence,"A developing offensive defenceman who often seems to want to play like a forward. A swift skater with a terrific shot and the desire to carry the puck to dangerous areas, he’s shown flashes of high-end skill when it comes to carrying the puck through the neutral zone and taking control of the game in the offensive zone. But he’s struggled to assert that same impact and instead has become a drag on possession, disengaged in his own zone while playing recklessly elsewhere. There’s a high ceiling and low floor."
Mattias Samuelsson,Buffalo Sabres,Defence,"A defensive defenceman who plays a low-maintenance game that involves very little time with the puck. Prefers to make a pass out of the defensive zone rather than chipping it out, but doesn’t have the puck-moving skills to pull it off without turning it over. A strong and quick skater who plays a tight gap off the rush and is willing to engage physically along the boards. A non-factor in the offensive zone, except to tee up his defensive partners for one-timers."
Mikael Backlund,Calgary Flames,Forward,"A defensive match-up centre, capable of playing heavy unpleasant minutes even in his mid-30s. Surprisingly active with the puck, especially in transition where he uses above-average skating and passing ability to get the puck up ice and create most of his offence. Generates shots from the perimeter but struggles to finish his opportunities. A high-end chance suppressor thanks to strong puck management, a smart defensive stick, and willingness to engage on the forecheck. Draws few penalties."
Blake Coleman,Calgary Flames,Forward,"A hybrid checking line utility scoring winger who can still create offensively even if he doesn’t play as fast and active on the forecheck as he used to. An opportunistic counter-attack player who can be lethal shorthanded and with the net empty, although his finishing touch is inconsistent from year to year. Despite sub-six foot frame, plays pretty physically and takes too many penalties as a result."
Jonathan Huberdeau,Calgary Flames,Forward,"A one-dimensional playmaking winger whose cerebral extra-pass game requires linemates who can think the game at a high level and finish his high-danger passes. At his best, few are capable of sending passes into the slot like he can, and on occasion he can put the puck in the net, but in his 30s he’s had issues creating the quantity of scoring chances required to compensate for his lack of footspeed and lack of defensive involvement."
Nazem Kadri,Calgary Flames,Forward,"A steady pass-first top six centre who loves to have the puck on his stick, take on defenders one-on-one, and run the offence. Willing to create offence from anywhere in the zone, and one of the most prolific generators of shots and tips from the outer slot as well as maintaining possession by feeding his blueliners for point shots. A well below-average skater, not a brilliant defender, and relatively disengaged physically and along the walls at this point, but moves the puck up the ice at an elite rate, avoids turnovers well, and has always been one of the best penalty drawers in the NHL."
Andrei Kuzmenko,Calgary Flames,Forward,"A skilled net-front winger who makes up for near league-worst skating and physicality through sheer craftiness. Despite a very low quantity of puck touches, he has excellent hands (especially in tight) and the finishing touch to take advantage of the extra space he creates by deking defenders and goalies. One of the most efficient finishers in hockey due in part to a total refusal to shoot from long range. You’ll almost never see him throw a check or battle on the boards."
Martin Pospisil,Calgary Flames,Forward,"A physical winger (and occasional centre) who plays a reckless wrecking-ball dump-and-chase-and-forecheck game. High-end speed combine with a willingness to fly into corners and chase hits to make him one of the game’s most effective puck retrievers and most prolific takers of minor and major penalties. Possesses sneaky offensive skill, especially near the net where his passing ability suggests the potential for a greater offensive role in the future."
Yegor Sharangovich,Calgary Flames,Forward,"A one-dimensional scoring forward (usually a winger but very occasionally a centre) who despite occasionally contributing on the forecheck or along the walls can most often be found waiting for the puck around the net-front. Has a broad range of tools for scoring goals, including tips, one-timers, and one of the few wrists shots in the league that can pretty reliably beat set goalies from range. Weak defensively, a non-factor physically, and below-average both in terms of skating and workload with the puck."
Connor Zary,Calgary Flames,Forward,"A young pass-first two-way forward who puts in the hard work on the forecheck and showed a willingness to absorb contact and get to the net. An efficient scorer who produces from within the blue paint, often with a defender draped over him, and likes to shoot from distance. Has terrific hands which he uses to counter-act below-average skating."
Rasmus Andersson,Calgary Flames,Defence,"A big-minute right-handed offensive defenceman who passes the puck effectively in the offensive zone at 5-on-5, although more often D-to-D and around the perimeter than deeper near the net. Active in transition but more often as a puck carrier on zone entries than as an ambitious puck-mover from his own zone. This, combined with a fairly straightforward net-front game in his own end, makes him better suited to an ambitious puck-moving partner who’s active on the walls in his own zone than a stay-at-home linemate. Plays a very soft gap off the rush to protect the middle of the ice, rolling the red carpet for forwards trying to enter the Flames zone with possession, but gives up chances at a pretty high rate anyway."
Kevin Bahl,Calgary Flames,Defence,"A low-event stay-at-home defenceman who uses imposing size and a long stick to disrupt plays in his own zone at even strength and on the powerplay. Can make a break-out pass if needed but not active in transition. Offensive game consists mainly of point shots. Not one of the most prolific body-checkers in the NHL but takes a lot of holding, interference, and roughing minor penalties."
Jake Bean,Calgary Flames,Defence,"A fringe defenceman with some flashes of skill with the puck and solid skating counteracted by a high turnover rate, lack of physicality, and spotty puck-moving. Establishing himself as more than a depth option would require expanding his play with the puck, especially in transition."
MacKenzie Weegar,Calgary Flames,Defence,"An adventurous two-way defenceman who wants to be involved in everything that happens on the ice. Extremely active with the puck, an elite puck-mover in transition, eager to join the rush or jump up in the cycle, first to loose pucks in the defensive zone, an active and ambitious play-killer and aggressive rush defender. Few defenders create as much offence from the point both by shooting and setting up one-timers, although production (and especially scoring) has been pretty inconsistent. While his style can on occasion make mistakes catastrophic, his failure rate is relatively low and throughout his career he’s been a very strong scoring chance suppressor."
Sebastian Aho,Carolina Hurricanes,Forward,"A number one two-way centre who contributes all over the ice in all situations. A jack-of-all-trades who’s terrific in every area of the game except for physicality. A versatile scorer who can put the puck in the net off one-timers from distance, rush plays, by going to the slot with the puck on his stick or to receive a pass, and by crashing the crease for loose pucks. A clever player who gets himself to the right spot at the right time. A superb passer who executes clean feeds across the crease and give-and-go plays, often carrying the puck in himself and finding a streaking linemate at just the right time."
Jackson Blake,Carolina Hurricanes,Forward,"A developing playmaking winger with a high motor and confidence with the puck in the offensive zone. Overcomes a lack of straight-line speed and size using creativity and stick-handling, absorbing contact and winding around the perimeter to open up shooting and passing lanes. Has a shot that can beat goalies off the rush and gets to the slot for one-timers but is especially gifted as a passer, giving linemates cleverly-timed feeds through the slot. Works hard on the forecheck to maintain possession and disrupt plays."
Nikolaj Ehlers,Carolina Hurricanes,Forward,"A dynamic first line scoring winger who carries the puck from end to end with tremendous speed and control. Loves to shoot the puck from long-range, using his skating ability to pull goalies out of position and often swooping across the width of the offensive zone to whip a wrist shot from the middle. Can score plenty of different ways including an old-school clapper from the wing. A shoot-first player but a great passer as well who moves the puck well off the rush and has a great sense of where his linemates are as he navigates the offensive zone. Won’t be in the Selke conversation but is very involved in his own end retrieving loose pucks and forcing turnovers and turning those plays into clean zone exits; that said, he won’t be caught dead throwing a hit or battling for a puck along the boards."
Taylor Hall,Carolina Hurricanes,Forward,"A veteran rushing playmaking winger who uses his speed and skating to create offence. SKates through the neutral zone with possession of the puck, using his quick feet and soft hands to navigate through defenders and create rush chances or establish offensive zone possession. A prolific passer but not an especially flashy one; moves around the zone looking for short area passes, understanding the importance of one-timers and changes of angle to open up space in the net. Despite star pedigree, willing to chase pucks, dig them out along the boards, and crash the net. Has breakaway speed but not finishing touch, and rarely beats goalies clean. A plus defender when fully engaged as a forechecker."
Jesperi Kotkaniemi,Carolina Hurricanes,Forward,"A middle-six two-way centre who shows flashes of the high-end skill he was drafted for but not with enough frequency to move permanently up the lineup. Above-average in various aspects of the game, such as carrying the puck in transition, passing the puck in the offensive zone, and firing the puck (as long as he has a lot of time and space), but lacks the dynamic element to be a true difference-maker at this point."
Jordan Martinook,Carolina Hurricanes,Forward,A third-line checking winger whose energetic forechecking game allows him to move around the lineup when needed. Solid straight-line speed and a high motor make him a menace for opposing defenders trying to retrieve a loose puck or make a clean break-out pass. Not a creative player with the puck but can make the straightforward play back up to the point to maintain possession and has a knack for getting his stick on point shots and tracking down rebounds. A helpful defensive presence at even strength and the penalty kill.
Seth Jarvis,Carolina Hurricanes,Forward,"A skilled forechecking winger who crashes the net and creates shots from in tight. Plays a hard-nosed game in all areas of the ice despite his lack of size, forechecking hard, winning battles, and absorbing abuse in the slot. Keeps his stick on the ice in the blue paint to receive passes and jam at rebounds, and provides a good screen and tip target on extended possessions and the powerplay. Has a nice shot from the outer slot, especially off the rush, but his finishing touch varies pretty dramatically. Similarly, dishes the puck very well in transition, delivering beautiful saucer passes through the slot, although his passing game is generally less ambitious and more focused on funneling pucks to the point or the half boards out of a puck retrieval."
Jordan Staal,Carolina Hurricanes,Forward,"A veteran bottom-six shut-down centre who plays a risk-averse, deliberate brand of hockey at both ends of the ice. Uses his big and sturdy frame to protect the puck and rarely turns it over, focusing on making the safe play out of his defensive zone or up to the point in the offensive zone rather than making more high-risk, high-reward moves. Boasts a terrific defensive stick and works hard on the forecheck and along the boards to disrupt plays and help his team maintain possession. Establishes a presence in the slot as a screener and tipper. A non-factor in transition and off the rush."
Logan Stankoven,Carolina Hurricanes,Forward,"A developing offensive forward who makes up for lack of size and separating foot-speed with a tenacious, energetic, up-tempo game. Especially dangerous off the rush, where his creativity and shot make him a consistent threat to score. Despite being only 5’8, he doesn’t hesitate to crash the net and be the first to a loose puck even when he’ll inevitably be punished for it. Draws plenty of penalties as a result."
Andrei Svechnikov,Carolina Hurricanes,Forward,"A skilled top-six winger with terrific tools and offensive ability but issues with consistency, finishing, defence, and discipline. Uses his 6’3 frame and powerful stride effectively to protect the puck and navigates in transition using his hands to beat opposing defenders to the outside and cut to the slot. Can bully his way around the offensive zone and thrives in extended offensive zone sequences when he can retrieve rebounds and loose pucks and assert his presence in the slot. Has a heavy shot which he uses liberally from the perimeter with not a ton of success. Plenty of passing skill as well. Not much of a factor defensively despite some physicality and tenacity on the forecheck, and has a bad habit of taking dumb penalties. Should be more productive than he has been throughout his career."
Jaccob Slavin,Carolina Hurricanes,Defence,"An elite number one defenceman who specializes in defending one-on-one and pushing play away from his net. Endlessly creative when it comes to finding ways to disrupt opponents, blending his quick feet and even quicker stick to close out rapidly, clamping down pass attempts not only by blocking and swatting but also by sprawling out and using his legs and hands. Once he gets the puck loose, he can make the right simple play to get it out of danger and his first step is fast enough that he can often head up-ice with it himself. Possesses a serviceable offensive skill-set and can swing the puck around the zone and get shots through, but his defensive game will always be the main attraction."
Shayne Gostisbehere,Carolina Hurricanes,Defence,"A crafty offensive defenceman who controls and moves the puck with skill and creativity. Not a fast or especially agile skater but uses stick-handling and poise to navigate the puck out of trouble and precise and versatile passing to get it to his forwards cleanly. A good decision-maker with the puck under pressure who can confidently execute an evasive move instead of forcing a bad play. Similarly assertive with the puck at the point, drifting towards the centre of the blueline and filtering hard shots through traffic. Toys with wingers defending the point by faking shots and passes and often just walking around them. Typically needs to be sheltered defensively due to his lack of size, speed, and awareness in his own end, but he can tilt the ice well against lesser competition."
Sean Walker,Carolina Hurricanes,Defence,"A mobile offensive defenceman with explosive skating ability and skill with the puck on his stick in transition and in the offensive zone. Compensates for lack of size by taking away space and using his stick to sweep away pucks, although he’s vulnerable to higher-level opponents. Can make the heads-up play to carry the puck out of danger and get the rush started. K’Andre Miller A toolsy two-way defenceman whose combination of size, reach, and skating ability gives him a lot of upside as a defender. Has generally held up well in difficult match-up minutes at even strength and the penalty kill, including with partners that leave him a bit vulnerable, but can get caught chasing or drifting out of position, exposing lanes to the net. An unexceptional transition player out of his own end but can jump up to help gain the offensive zone. Once there, moves the puck but moreso around the perimeter than into dangerous areas. Nice finishing touch but doesn’t shoot the puck much."
Connor Bedard,Chicago Blackhawks,Forward,"A developing scoring centre who’s shown flashes of elite skill and the ability to create quality offence without much help. Boasts a special wrist shot with a deceptive release and pin-point accuracy, although he’s still working out how to get the space to use it against NHL defenders and goalies. That said, opponents respect that shot so much that they gravitate towards him, especially on the man advantage, which he can exploit with his playmaking skill. He’s an extremely high-I.Q. passer who understands the value of manipulation and constantly keeps defenders guessing whether he’s going to dish it until it’s too late. Cheeky short-range saucer passes are his favourite, especially in odd-man situations. Already one of the most skilled players in the league at entering the offensive zone with possession and unlike some similar young forwards in the past, he didn’t have an issue turning those entries into rush opportunities. His main issue at this point is that he can struggle to dictate play given his lack of foot-speed and size, which could cap his upside relative to similar-pedigree peers. That said, he has some grit and snarl to him and uses his strong frame to protect pucks; nonetheless, by no means a forechecker or board battler. Defence overall is a work in progress to say the least."
Tyler Bertuzzi,Chicago Blackhawks,Forward,"A pesky net-front top six winger who mixes forechecking mayhem and passing skill to create offence in tight. Scores almost all his goals from within a few feet of the blue paint on extended offensive zone possessions, keeping his stick on the ice and providing a target for high-danger passes and deflections. Not a pure mucker though, and even when playing the garbage-man role can make bang-bang passes into the slot with not a lot of space to work with. Can get caught deep in the zone and quite turnover-prone, an especially troubling defensive habit due to his poor foot-speed. Andrei Burakovsky A scoring winger who, when he’s on, can put the puck in the net with high efficiency, although his lack of volume limits his goal totals. Boasts a wicked wrist shot and has the hands to gain extra time and space to get it off. Also a significant one-timer threat as a lefty who plays mostly on the right wing, but doesn’t use it too often and prefers to hold the puck for a second before putting it on net. A dual threat on offence who carries the puck in transition and attacks off the rush, picking corners himself or using strong passing skills to force goalies to move laterally. Has excellent hands which he uses to manipulate opposing defenders and goalies alike. Has lost a bit of a step in recent years and struggles on the defensive side of the puck."
Jason Dickinson,Chicago Blackhawks,Forward,"A third line workhorse shut-down centre who disrupts skilled opponents through physicality and a superb defensive stick. Battles for pucks along the wall, kills penalties, and has steadily improved in the faceoff dot over the years. Quite limited offensively, mostly playing a chip-and-chase game, but flashed some long-range sniping with a curl-and-drag wrist shot."
Nick Foligno,Chicago Blackhawks,Forward,"A hard-working veteran defensive winger. Makes up in physicality what he lacks in skating speed, engaging with opponents both with his stick and plenty of body-checks. Puts in effort in his own end of the ice to retrieve pucks and start the break-out, but unsurprisingly his instinct is to make the chip-and-chase play more often than not. Can plug in higher up the lineup, playing a complementary game and crashing the net, but probably best-suited to a shutdown line."
Ilya Mikheyev,Chicago Blackhawks,Forward,"A shot-first winger who creates chances in the net-front, from the center lane, and off the rush. A knee injury in 2022 took a big chunk out of his footspeed, which was previously the focal point of his game; it remains to be seen whether he can regain it. Despite not being able to move as quickly as before, he still does most of his damage in transition and has the instincts to get to the right spots to grab passes and sneak behind defences. While he’s overall graded out well as a finisher, he’s undeniably streaky and has a bad habit of shooting from a bit too far out on squared-up goalies. A nose for the net and strong hand-eye in front add another dimension to his game."
Teuvo Teravainen,Chicago Blackhawks,Forward,"A versatile two-way playmaking winger who contributes in all situations, especially on the penalty kill where he’s one of the more effective forwards in the game. Despite being one of the slowest skaters in the league and spending very little time with the puck, he’s a stabilizing presence whether on a scoring or shutdown line that works hard on the forecheck, chases down loose pucks in both zones, and funnels pucks from deep in the zone up to the point to maintain possession. A pass-first player but has a sneaky great one-timer from the right wing; on almost every one of his goals, the puck is in the net within a second of it hitting his blade."
TJ Brodie,Chicago Blackhawks,Defence,"A veteran defensive defenceman with some puck-moving ability. For years one of the most stabilizing defenders in the league, making up for total lack of physicality with smart positioning and one of the league’s best defensive sticks, but rapidly-declining skating appeared to completely compromise his game almost overnight as he started getting walked and his confidence to make safe plays with the puck collapsed. At his best, provides a safety blanket to skilled linemates and moves the puck without wasting possessions on doomed point shots; at his worst, doesn’t provide much of anything."
Alec Martinez,Chicago Blackhawks,Defence,"A veteran stay-at-home defenceman who is indeed plenty more comfortable absorbing pucks in the defensive zone than doing much else with it. Like many other players of his profile, his offensive contributions are mostly limited to putting pucks on net from long distance. Not a player who’s going to chase pucks around, throw hits, or get too engaged physically; he’s happier protecting the middle of the ice and letting somebody else move their feet."
Alex Vlasic,Chicago Blackhawks,Defence,"A developing defensive defenceman and penalty killer who pursues the puck in his own end and transports it out of danger. A strong skater willing to move his feet in the defensive zone and not shy to battle for the puck even if he’s not much of a hitter. Has flashed some ceiling-raising passing ability including some slick stretch passes, but still working on avoiding turnovers while moving the puck. Has already proven he can handle difficult minutes."
Nathan MacKinnon,Colorado Avalanche,Forward,"A superstar offensive centre who overpowers opponents with a combination of speed, strength, and skill. If not the fastest player in the world in terms of absolute top-end speed, certainly plays faster than anybody else, using tremendous physical fitness to barrel past opponents with singular frequency and reaching his top speed in only a few powerful strides. That would be dangerous enough on its own, but add in some of the best hands in the league and pure lower-body power and there’s a reason defencemen panic when they see him rev up through the neutral zone. Far from a one-trick pony, the rush is only one way that he strikes. On extended offensive zone possessions and powerplays he weaponizes a deadly and accurate one-timer from either the centre lane or the left circle, and frankly he’s perfectly happy to fire wristers from anywhere on the ice and crash the net too. As a playmaker, he’s exceptional at identifying gaps in defensive coverage and funneling pucks to the slot, taking advantage of his own gravity to create openings and executing difficult passes with tape-to-tape precision. As a defender he’s less engaged, with weakness in the faceoff dot a microcosm of the surprising lack of forechecking and puck battling in his game. That said, it isn’t difficult to envision his legendary competitiveness translating to a more attentive game in his own end in the future."
Ross Colton,Colorado Avalanche,Forward,"A physical shoot-first energy forward who crashes the net, chases down pucks, and throws body checks. Plays a straight-line and straightforward game, with limited puck skills and passing mostly limited to possession-extending passes to the point. Peppers the net with shots on goal, especially from the inner slot, but scores lots of goals on quick-strike rushes and breakaways from the centre lane."
Artturi Lehkonen,Colorado Avalanche,Forward,"A net-crashing forechecking utility winger. A nose for the net and the corners combine with a willingness to do the dirty work everywhere on the ice to make him an excellent defensive player both at 5-on-5 and on the penalty kill. Makes his stick available in the middle of the ice and rarely has the puck on it for long before putting it on net; an above-average finishing touch in tight doesn’t hurt either. His defensive conscience and ability to keep up with speedy linemates has kept him high in the lineup despite doing little with the puck himself, but a loss of footspeed in the past few seasons may take a toll on his even strength effectiveness."
Martin Necas,Colorado Avalanche,Forward,"A dynamic first line playmaking winger whose combination of speed and puck skills make him almost impossible to contain. Loves to carry the puck through the neutral zone and possess it high in the offensive zone, giving himself space and time to direct the flow of play and initiate dizzying high-cycles that expose passing lanes. Weaves through multiple defenders through the neutral zone and can read play at top speed. Less attentive to the defensive aspects of the game, although he can steal pucks."
Brock Nelson,Colorado Avalanche,Forward,"A veteran top six scoring centre with an array of tools he deploys to put the puck in the net. Has a surprisingly explosive first step that he uses to create numerical mismatches on the counter-attack including a high volume of breakaways. Exploits movement and timing to open up goaltenders and snipe from the wing, has great hands in tight, and gets to the right spot to snap home one-timers as well. Can also play a useful role off the cycle, screening the goalie and tipping the puck or timing routes to the back-door. Has a nice defensive stick but his run-and-gun tendencies can have consequences withou the puck."
Valeri Nichushkin,Colorado Avalanche,Forward,"A top-line two-way winger whose rare combination of size, speed, skill, and hard work makes him a force on the ice. Uses his big frame, high-end skating, and excellent hands to carry the puck in transition, leading to lots of rush opportunities. Not afraid to go to the net and jam at pucks in the blue paint, and is effective as a screener and deflector. Not a flashy or ambitious passer but an effective one who can hit the trailer, has a nice touch around the net, and has a good eye for short one-time options. Is at his most impactful as a two-way player when he uses his physical gifts to win races and battles for loose pucks and pressure opposing defenders."
Cale Makar,Colorado Avalanche,Defence,"A superstar offensive defenceman who plays with the skill of an elite scoring forward. Between his unbelievable skating ability (which allows him to gallop up the ice with speed, walk the blueline gracefully, and skate backwards with elite agility), his sensational hands, a high hockey I.Q., and one of the absolute best shots in hockey, he’s a terror when he hits the ice, especially when paired with high-end forwards to work with. He gets himself into prime scoring locations at a higher rate than any other defenceman, jumping up in the play and either taking the chances himself or exploiting his gravity to hit a teammate in a high-danger area. An active defender who blocks passing lanes, recovers pucks, and has always defended the rush well using his excellent skating to disrupt opponents."
Devon Toews,Colorado Avalanche,Defence,"A top-pairing two-way defenceman with tremendous skills both on and off the puck. Combines smooth skating, an active stick, and elite puck-moving to tilt the ice and complement skilled linemates. Because of his speed he can afford to be proactive snuffing out plays and aggressively attacking the puck with stick checks while cutting off lanes with his skates; also intercepts passes and clearing attempts by pushing off into them. It doesn’t hurt that he can turn defence to offence quicker than almost anyone in the game and connect on long-distance stretch passes. Smart and adaptable, putting himself in the right positioning offensively to both act as a safety valve while linemates get ambitious and give them a sneaky and undetected option who’s a threat to score himself. Like many relatively undersized blueliners, his primary weakness comes right at the net-mouth where he can get out-muscled and lose track of the play and where his skating ceases to be an advantage."
Samuel Girard,Colorado Avalanche,Defence,"A mobile puck-moving defenceman whose agility and creativity with the puck combine with his minute size to make him one of the more unique players in the league. Moves nimbly and confidently up the ice with the puck and swings around the top of the offensive zone, occupying defenders and opening space which he can exploit with a quick pass or a low shot into traffic. Not a liability defensively but definitely exploitable as he can make the wrong read defending the rush and get easily outmuscled in tight."
Charlie Coyle,Columbus Blue Jackets,Forward,"A veteran net-crashing centre. Underratedly slick hands on both sides of the puck, forcing turnovers and making smooth passes into the slot look easy. As a scorer, does all his damage within a few feet of the net, getting his stick on the ice for cross-crease one-timers and deflections and occasionally showing off those hands again. An average skater who brings some size and physicality, although despite often being deployed as a shut-down centre and being an effective one-on-one defender he struggles to suppress scoring chances."
Adam Fantilli,Columbus Blue Jackets,Forward,"A developing scoring centre whose elite tools give him sky-high upside. Possesses size, elite speed, a deadly shot, and tons of power as he barrels up ice and forces defences to react quick or get blown past. His release is quick and lethal, allowing him to beat goalies from anywhere on the ice and get clean shots off with very little space. He’s especially dangerous off the rush and creates a lot of breakaways where his signature backhand-forehand move crosses goalies up surprisingly often. Flashes jaw-dropping passing skill but can sometimes push the pace a bit too much and end up turning the puck over or making the wrong read. Has a very high motor and eagerly participates defensively, breaking up plays with his stick and generating counter-attacks, but is similarly unpolished without the puck."
Boone Jenner,Columbus Blue Jackets,Forward,
Kent Johnson,Columbus Blue Jackets,Forward,"A developing play-making winger with dynamic and deceptive puck skills. Aware of the limits posed by his below-average speed and lack of strength, he prioritizes creativity and manipulation, reading the play and staying out of the fray without the puck before attacking open space, liberally deploying fake passes and shots, and misdirecting defencemen and goaltenders. Moves with agility around the zone and fires the puck halfway through dekes, catching goalies off guard. Active on the forecheck and plays with a high motor defensively, even though his physicality is non-existent and his awareness in his own end isn’t fully developed."
Kirill Marchenko,Columbus Blue Jackets,Forward,"A first line offensive winger with dynamic puck skills and a high-end shot. Possesses the confidence and ability to attempt and execute ambitious plays with the puck, aggressively attacking the triangle or evading poke checks with curl-and-drag moves. Uses quick acceleration and his big frame to blow past and protect the puck from defenders while forcing opponents to respect both his wrist shot abilities and slick playmaking. Talented at reeling in less-than-ideal passes and advancing the play without hesitation."
Sean Monahan,Columbus Blue Jackets,Forward,"A top-six utility centre who brings a stabilizing playmaking presence, occupying the middle of the ice and making simple and smart plays to advance the play. Posts up in the net-front, crashing for rebounds and screening the goalie, but knows when to disengage and hide at the back-door for a cross-slot feed. A keen puck-battler with a great stick who can win pucks off the wall and maintain offensive zone possessions. An effective if not flashy passer who reads the play quickly and delivers short, precise feeds up ice to quicker linemates in transition or through the slot within the zone. Diminished foot-speed makes him more of a fill-in-the-blanks player now, but it’s a role he can play effectively."
Miles Wood,Columbus Blue Jackets,Forward,"A speedy rushing winger who plays a run-and-gun game, crashes the net, and finishes his checks. Uses his near-league-best footspeed to create piles of rush opportunities both for himself and his linemates while contributing a physical element, but struggles to finish his chances and gives up a lot the other way as a result. That he’s not quite skilled enough to earn a larger role but too one-dimensional player to anchor a defensive bottom six line makes him tough to slot in."
Dmitri Voronkov,Columbus Blue Jackets,Forward,"A developing power forward whose size and positioning have allowed him to carve out a role as a net-front puck battler and garbage-goal scorer. Spends very little time with the puck on his stick, as his lack of grace as a skater and handler prevent him from creating much. What he does do is post up in the inner slot, win position, fight for pucks along the wall, and smack home pucks. Has the smarts to smack pucks off the wall or through the slot to his linemates but doesn’t exactly have finesse as a passer. Finishes his checks but is otherwise extremely uninvolved defensively and takes a ton of penalties."
Ivan Provorov,Columbus Blue Jackets,Defence,"A veteran defenceman who can absorb heavy minutes with decent positioning, serviceable puck battling, and some puck-moving and carrying ability. Not advanced enough in any one area of the game to drive play and has become increasingly exploitable off the rush."
Zach Werenski,Columbus Blue Jackets,Defence,"A number one offensive defenceman who dominates when he’s at his best, using elite skating and superb puck skills to break apart his opponent’s structure and create offence. Prowls the blue-line constantly reading the play and identifying opportunities to leap into the slot, and doesn’t hesitate to make the ultra-aggressive play to pinch along the boards or shut down a break out because he trusts himself to execute. Carries the puck with real authority, always scanning and using pivots and fakes to buy himself more time as he navigates the neutral and offensive zone and protecting the puck with a solid base. Has a heavy shot from the point but is always looking for ways to get in tighter and make his chances more dangerous. An elite puck-mover whose awareness and versatility in transition constantly keep opponents guessing and is liable to snap a game-breaking stretch pass to a streaking linemate. An imperfect defensive player, and certainly not a physical one, but extremely active in his own end aggressively killing plays, blocking lanes, and winning races to loose pucks."
Matt Duchene,Dallas Stars,Forward,"A veteran top six offensive centre who uses smooth skating and high-end hands to navigate the ice and create scoring chances for him and his linemates. While no longer one of the fastest players in the league, he’s still quick and crafty enough to carry the puck through the neutral zone and generate rush opportunities at elite rates, often dangling around opposing defenders in the process. His comfort holding on to the puck against pressure opens up lanes in the offensive zone and he has enough playmaking skill to exploit them both in transition and on extended possessions. Can beat goalies from the high slot with a deadly wrist shot but has no issue shooting for deflections in front. Not a physical player at all, but sneaks into the slot to receive passes and take quick shots. Not a strong defender and is mostly focused on going from defence to offence rather than battling for pucks or pitching in on the forecheck."
Mikael Granlund,Dallas Stars,Forward,"A veteran pass-first offensive forward. Patient and deliberate with the puck, capable of executing high-skilled passing plays through dangerous areas of the ice. Challenges defenders and opens up passing lanes with soft hands, setting up one-timers around the offensive zone. A low-volume shooter who occasionally dazzles with a perfectly-placed wrist shot when he has time and space. By no means a lazy defensive player and often takes on penalty-killing responsibilities, but gives up a lot of chances by virtue both of his lack of foot-speed on the back-check and awareness in his own end; it is not uncommon to see him caught chasing and flailing at the puck ineffectively on d-zone sequences. As a result, while his playmaking skill-set suits him offensively at centre, he can cancel out that impact defensively."
Roope Hintz,Dallas Stars,Forward,"A dynamic first line scoring centre whose acceleration and top-end speed is matched by few players in the game. As his best, is a one-man rush offence machine who goes from zero to full speed in only a few quick bursts and has the hands, size, and strength to punish defenders who try to disrupt him early. Once he’s in the clear he’s slick on breakaways as well. Has veered towards being a bit of a one-trick pony who increasingly relies on the rush to create offence but does provide value in the zone, as evidenced by his effectiveness as a triggerman in the bumper spot on the powerplay. A skilled passer who sees the ice very well even when he’s in full flight and can make crisp, slick passes to streaking linemates. Takes advantage of his own speed by exploiting the drop pass off an entry to give his linemates extra space to shoot or set up give-and-go plays. Not a high-end defensive contributor at even strength and isn’t much of a hitter or puck retriever, but uses his skating and solid stick as an asset on the penalty kill."
Wyatt Johnston,Dallas Stars,Forward,"A first line centre with a knack for generating piles of scoring chances from deadly areas of the ice. Haunts the slot, not just mindlessly crashing the net but carefully timing his routes and getting to the right place at the right time with his stick on the ice. Weaponizes the goal line, hanging out just far away enough from the back door to get lost, and is unafraid to put pucks on net from places where it shouldn’t really be possible to score. Combined with a great release and sick hands off the rush that often make defenders look incompetent and goalies look horizontal, it’s tough to stop him from getting to the slot. On the powerplay can play the left wing, the net-front, and the bumper successfully because of his versatility as a scorer. Not blazingly fast but very agile and deceptive with the puck on his stick which gives him the extra space he needs to move the puck effectively; when he has time he can execute very clean high-danger passes but otherwise he more often shovels pucks to the right spot which makes him extra-dangerous in the slot. Not big himself (and looks pretty small on the ice) but plays through contact very well. Has the potential to be a solid defensive player but for now is mostly focused on keeping the tempo up and creating offence."
Mason Marchment,Dallas Stars,Forward,
Mikko Rantanen,Dallas Stars,Forward,"A star offensive winger whose size, finishing touch, and passing ability make him one of the toughest players to defend in the league. Can score from anywhere, with an accurate wrist shot from distance, a great one-timer, and a knack for getting to the right area for a cross-seam pass. Is also useful at the net-front where his touch on deflections adds another layer of deception on extended offensive zone possessions. Creates a high volume of chances by passing the puck but is better at making the simple and smart play to a linemate headed towards the slot or an open defenceman at the top of the zone than nailing tape-to-tape feeds through traffic in front. Not an especially prolific transition player mostly because of his linemate, but uses combo of hands and size to protect the puck when carrying it into the offensive zone. For all that he uses his size offensively, he isn’t much of a forechecker, hitter, or battler and is rarely a difference-maker in his own zone. Excels when the games tighten up and his small-area game and versatility become more important."
Jason Robertson,Dallas Stars,Forward,"A star two-way scoring winger with a heavy and accurate wrist shot who contributes at both ends of the ice. Uses his strong 6’3 frame and high hockey IQ to overcome his lack of skating speed and agility, which dropped him in the draft and were never really rectified as he developed. Punishes defenders for giving him space to wind up his shot and has a knack for finding the soft spots on the ice to receive passes and create quality opportunities. Not above mucking it up in front of the net, out-muscling defenders, and jumping on rebounds either. Not typically the primary puck carrier on his line, filling in the blanks in transition with smart quick passes and working out where he needs to be to provide options to his linemates. Has embraced a bigger defensive role, very active in the defensive zone recovering loose pucks and initiating zone exits to tilt the ice in his team’s direction."
Tyler Seguin,Dallas Stars,Forward,
Thomas Harley,Dallas Stars,Defence,"A number one offensive defenceman with a tremendous all-around game. Elite mobility, a ton of skill, and the desire to be involved in absolutely everything on the ice makes him one of the most eye-catching blueliners in the game. Joins the rush with astonishing aggressiveness, often beating his own forwards to the punch and blasting up the middle of the ice at top speed to receive passes and lead the entry. Whereas most blueliners will deliver a break-out pass and then let the forwards take their reins, he takes it as an opportunity to dart up-ice. While calling a defenceman a rover is often a pejorative, he really does look like a forward when he dekes opponents in the neutral zone and carries the puck with speed down the left wing; unlike many with that label he’s an eager defender who uses his motor to get back, disrupt plays, and defend the blueline. Once set up in the offensive zone, walks the line with ease, and fluidly looms around the top of the ice when he doesn’t have the puck, providing cycling options and keeping pucks in. His wicked wrister from the high slot and centre point is his main offensive weapon. In his own end, he’s not a hitter but will aggressively try to kill plays, which often works but sometimes get him stuck in no-man’s land as clever opponents draw him away from the net."
Esa Lindell,Dallas Stars,Defence,
Cody Ceci,Dallas Stars,Defence,
Miro Heiskanen,Dallas Stars,Defence,"An elite franchise defenceman with dynamic skating and puck-handling ability and the capacity to take over shifts. Uses his speed and agility to great effect on both sides of the puck, winning races and initiating break-outs at a high rate and with enviable success while taking away time and space and disrupting plays. If needed, he can be the focal point of the offence, transporting the puck end-to-end and controlling the play from the blue-line, but he can also contribute in more subtle ways by supporting his linemates, gaining the zone and then deferring, and setting up scoring chances."
J.T. Compher,Detroit Red Wings,Forward,"A middle-six shutdown centre who’s added a playmaking dimension to his game in recent years which makes him a reasonable second-line option. While not a physical player or even that prolific a forechecker, he does have a knack for pulling pucks out of corners and to linemates in the middle of the ice. Plays an otherwise careful game with few risks or turnovers. A very efficient scorer in large part because he rarely shoots the puck, and when he does it’s mostly on scramble plays or tap-ins. Despite otherwise strong puck battling, really struggles in the dot."
Andrew Copp,Detroit Red Wings,Forward,
Alex DeBrincat,Detroit Red Wings,Forward,"A top-six scoring winger who gets to the right areas of the ice to fire accurate, if not thunderous, one-timers off the rush, in the slot, and from the left circle on the powerplay. Can also take advantage of extra space to carry the puck to the net and wire it in, although finishing his numerous opportunities to score at even strength  has been a consistent issue lately. By no means a one-dimensional player, is a skilled passer as well who can make heads-up feeds through the middle of the ice and exploit his threat to score to find open linemates. A fairly slow skater although clever enough to create odd-man opportunities and breakaways nonetheless. Small but sturdy frame is fine for protecting the puck but unsurprisingly a non-factor physically or defensively."
Patrick Kane,Detroit Red Wings,Forward,"A veteran offensive winger. At his best, he controls the tempo of the game from the perimeter with manipulative passing, patiently waiting to set-up dangerous chances rather than forcing the play or creating a high volume of shots in tight. Has started to embrace his lack of straight-line speed and create more off of lengthy offensive zone sequences, setting up point shots as well as high-danger cross-ice feeds and reducing his rate of turnovers. Deception remains a core aspect of his game, and he uses it to open shooting lanes and trick goalies, allowing his smooth wrist shot to strike from range. One of the least physical players in the game, with a defensive game limited to opportunistically seeking chances to exit the defensive zone with the puck."
Dylan Larkin,Detroit Red Wings,Forward,"A well-rounded top line centre with superb puck skills. A great skater (although his straightline speed isn’t where it was in his early 20s) and carries the puck with speed in transition from his own end to the offensive zone like few others. A utility goal scorer who can strike off the rush, beat goalies from outside -- sometimes from odd angles or out of mid-air -- or do the dirty work in tight. A clever passer who finds the open man in transition, often favouring the option to hit the trailer rather than force a feed through traffic; also makes sneaky plays out of forechecks and puck battles to set up linemates. Doesn’t have the elite skill in any one area to reach the upper echelon of centres but nonetheless capable of driving a top line. An above-average defensive player who puts in the work in his own zone to break up plays, recover loose pucks, and get the puck out of trouble. Kills penalties and uses his skating to draw them too."
Lucas Raymond,Detroit Red Wings,Forward,"A developing scoring winger with plenty of skill with the puck and a nose for the net. Goes to the dangerous areas of the ice and makes himself available for high-danger feeds from linemates at even strength and as the bumper on the powerplay, which he deposits at a high rate, as well as rebounds and other uglier ways to put the puck in the net. Increasingly comfortable shooting from the outer slot and can beat goalies from range with an accurate wrist shot. Maybe the most promising aspects of his game are his burgeoning confidence with the puck, which combined with his skilled hands leads to some highlight-reel efforts, and an improving and high-upside passing game feeding pucks into the slot. Both of these developments suggest star upside, although they’ll need to be asserted more consistently to get there. A hard worker without the puck but a bit turnover prone and defers to making uncontrolled plays too often in transition."
Vladimir Tarasenko,Detroit Red Wings,Forward,"A veteran scoring winger who can still rip pucks from the perimeter but can also use his size and strength to get to the net. Despite below-average speed, a more limited role as a puck-carrier in transition, and less of a predeliction to take on defenders one-on-one, the rush remains his most consistent avenue for creating offence, and he finds himself in odd-man sequences frequently where he can dish the puck and smack home one-timers. This run-and-gun style puts a lot of stress on his goalies and it doesn’t help that he’s not much of a forechecker or battler, although he will finish his checks."
Moritz Seider,Detroit Red Wings,Defence,"A developing defence-first defenceman capable of shouldering an immensely heavy load against tough competition. Physical presence in the defensive zone has always been the core of his game, not just in terms of punishing hits but using his body to disrupt plays, block shots and passes, separate opponents from the puck, and push rushing forwards to the perimeter. An aggressive transition defender who plays a tight gap and forces forwards to think twice before trying to advance the puck cleanly across his blueline. An efficient defensive skater who gets to and wins loose pucks in his own end. A decent but unexceptional puck-mover who almost always elects to either make the safe play up the wall in transition or confidently carry it up ice himself instead of completing a stretch pass, and eager to join the rush whenever possible. Controls the puck fairly well at the top of the offensive zone and has a strong sense for when to jump up in the play to receive a pass and get a scoring chance."
Simon Edvinsson,Detroit Red Wings,Defence,"A developing two-way defenceman with a terrific tool-kit and plenty of potential at both ends of the ice. His 6’6 size and huge wingspan paired with great footwork and solid mobility allow him to kill plays effectively and aggressively ward off in-coming rush attacks. Plays with a lot of confidence and a high risk tolerance, jumping up in the play and deking through sticks and bodies in the neutral and offensive zone. A high turnover rate and the propensity to occasionally get burned hard is the result, but these details can be ironed out. Displays upside as a puck-mover and has also shown flashes of physical dominance as an in-zone defender."
Ben Chiarot,Detroit Red Wings,Defence,
Connor McDavid,Edmonton Oilers,Forward,"A generational player, dominant at a level arguably not seen in decades. One of the fastest straight-line skaters in the sport but impossibly controlled at top speed, both in terms of agility and puck handling. Frequently blasts past defenders and stickhandles around them while they desperately try to keep up. Elite at everything offensively. Not only an extremely gifted passer technically, but navigates the offensive zone on extended possessions and uses his unparalleled ability with the puck to make defencemen panic and open up passing lanes before exploiting split-second gaps in coverage with a pass straight into the slot. Maybe the best in the league at skating the puck behind the net and emerging on the other side to hit the trailer for a scoring chance; even offensive zone cycles have the fluidity and movement of rush play. In transition, there are few who compare to his brilliance in full flight and with the right partner he can shred defences with odd-man give-and-goes. A pass-first player generally except for the rush where it’s effectively 50/50, and when he scores it’s more likely because he used his hands or pre-shot passing to give himself an opening than because he overpowered the goalie with a snipe. Deploys an arsenal of feints and fakes seemingly in fast-forward that leave goaltenders and often defencemen flat on their face by the time the puck comes off his stick. Has grown into a capable defensive player, no longer recklessly trading chances and improving considerably in terms of play in his own zone and using his speed and skill to proactively strip pucks and tilt the ice. Will never be known for his physical play but is sturdy, strong, and willing to engage along the wall and in dirty areas of the ice."
Leon Draisaitl,Edmonton Oilers,Forward,"A superstar franchise centre who combines passing skill and pinpoint accurate shooting like arguably nobody else in the game. Makes picking corners from anywhere on the ice, including the goal-line, look easy and almost casual, beating goalies with wrist shots, one-timers, and even backhanders with consistency. Elite vision combines with that sublime control of the puck to make him one of the top playmakers in the game, sending precise saucer passes from the forehand and backhand and connecting give-and-go plays on odd-man rushes. This dual-threat status and his ability to score from anywhere has made him one of the best man-advantage players in the game. His slightly hunched-over skating stride lacks the elegance of his generational teammate’s, but it’s sturdy and sneakily powerful and he can move up ice quite quickly both while handling the puck and tracking towards the net off-puck. Creates his own opportunities by deking opponents and protecting the puck. Despite his strong frame, not a physical player and separates opponents from the puck with his stick instead of his body. Possesses some defensive skill but his commitment to that side of the game has been inconsistent."
Trent Frederic,Edmonton Oilers,Forward,"A physical scoring winger who enthusiastically battles for pucks and throws body-checks while displaying flashes of more ambitious play with the puck. Scores most of his goals by jumping on loose pucks in the inner slot, although his shot can beat goalies from range on occasion. Not much of a playmaker save for the occasional dish in a net-front scramble or puck thrown into the slot. Offensive upside is probably capped out but could possibly be a puck retriever and net-front player on a higher line."
Ryan Nugent-Hopkins,Edmonton Oilers,Forward,"A complementary top-six forward who can play centre or left-wing. Whereas his hockey I.Q. used to manifest as high-end playmaking when he was younger, now he uses it to expertly fill in the blanks and work off the puck to connect dots and provide options for his linemates. Can play a net-front role jumping on rebounds and deflecting pucks, can move around the middle of the slot and the back-door to provide targets for high-danger passes, and can execute give-and-go plays at a high level. His vision and patience are on display in transition, where he provides support throughout break-outs by understanding where all his linemates are and sending short-range passes, and on the powerplay where he comfortably moves all over the ice to connect dots for his superstar linemates."
Zach Hyman,Edmonton Oilers,Forward,"A complementary net-front scoring winger who more than makes up for average puck skills through hard work and a nose for the net. Battles through contact along the boards and in the crease to get open, screen the goalie, and get his stick on point shots and loose pucks. Creative when it comes to giving his linemates options, including by using his body as well as his stick as a target to deflect shots and hard passes. Doesn’t control the puck very often in transition but makes simple yet effective plays with it in the offensive zone, including by catching opponents off-guard by making a straight line from the corner to the slot. By no means devoid of skill and can read the play well enough to shovel pucks towards open linemates in the slot. Uses his speed to win races to loose pucks and create quite a few breakaways, and has a good enough shot to beat goalies when he has space to get off a shot from the high slot. Has never been a particularly active defensive player, blowing the zone early and providing most of his off-puck value by forechecking and battling in the offensive zone."
Evander Kane,Edmonton Oilers,Forward,"A shoot-first power forward who plays a simple game premised on speed, checking, and scoring. Can shoot the puck well, gets to the slot, and is still an above-average straight-line skater, but is a poor play-driver at both ends and needs to play with a high-end playmaker to maximize his skillset. Extremely undisciplined when it comes to taking penalties, spending a ton of time in the box for ticky-tack stick infractions like high-sticks, trips, and hooks in addition to the roughings and fights that come with his style of play."
Connor Brown,Edmonton Oilers,Forward,"A middle-six rushing two-way shot-first winger. Reasonably skilled with the puck, capable of carrying it in and generating chances for himself and his linemates in transition. More limited on offensive-zone possessions where he simplifies and goes to the net to receive passes through the slot. Provides defensive value at even strength and the penalty kill using his skating and solid puck management."
Adam Henrique,Edmonton Oilers,Forward,A veteran bottom-six centre who hangs out near the net and waits for the play to come to him. Despite being a scorer is extremely choosy with his shots and generates almost all of his offence on one-timers in the slot. Doesn’t have the wheels to keep up on the rush or the puck skills to be a factor in transition and will never be mistaken for a high-end playmaker. Not a shutdown player but provides some value in his own-zone helping to facilitate zone exits.
Corey Perry,Edmonton Oilers,Forward,A veteran net-front winger who compensates for the near-total erosion of his foot-speed by camping out in the inner slot and putting pucks in the net. Flashes some of his old superstar skill with small-area plays in tight but spends practically no time with the puck on his stick and relies on linemates to carry the play. Still provides peskiness between the whistles.
Evan Bouchard,Edmonton Oilers,Defence,"A #1 offensive defenceman with a booming shot from the point and undeniable and ice-tilting skill as a passer in transition. One of the few blueliners who can beat goaltenders from range with consistency off of one-timed clappers and clever at timing low shots through traffic to be deflected or rebounded. An effective transition player who rarely turns over puck when moving it up-ice, even under tight pressure, and is equally effective carrying it and passing it through the neutral zone. One of the top puck-moving defencemen in the NHL, capable of executing lengthy stretch passes and cycling the puck around the offensive zone effectively. Has some strengths as a defender, such as a good defensive stick that blocks passing lanes & knocks away pucks as well as a knack for recovering loose pucks along the boards and moving them without turning it over, but can also get a bit lost in his own end and has a very frustrating knack to get beat off the rush in humiliating fashion by over-committing at the line and getting walked. Can tend to panic and make the wrong read off a turn-over, compounding mistakes until the puck ends up in his net. The even-keeled disposition that makes his offensive game scale flawlessly to the postseason tends to look like a lack of intensity in those big moments."
Mattias Ekholm,Edmonton Oilers,Defence,"A top-pairing versatile two-way defender who provides a stabilizing presence by preventing chances in his own end and cleanly moving the puck in transition. Uses his high-end defensive stick to break up plays at the blueline and protect the slot, keeping up with opposing forwards with his long reach and solid mobility. Executes plays under pressure in the defensive zone and moves the puck up ice. A low-maintenance partner for an offensive defenceman but has plenty of skill of his own and has no qualms about jumping up in the play and pinching deep into the offensive zone if the opportunity presents himself."
Darnell Nurse,Edmonton Oilers,Defence,"A top four offensive defenceman capable of logging big minutes and carrying the puck. A gifted athlete with impressive mobility for his size who lugs the puck up-ice with speed and enters the offensive zone with the puck frequently. Like Seth Jones and Colton Parayko, he would much rather lean on his skating and strength and carry the puck himself than be forced to make a more creative play and pass the puck to a rushing forward. Plays a relatively simple game in the offensive zone with plenty of pucks on net but is willing to jump up in the play and show flashes of skill. Helps to maintain possession and keep pucks in the o-zone. Can be a bit shaky and turnover prone in his own zone, struggles against heavy pressure in small areas, and is quick to panic and hit the ground. On the other hand, he brings some physicality (although not as much along the boards as you’d expect) and can clear the crease reasonably well."
Brett Kulak,Edmonton Oilers,Defence,"A smooth-skating top four defence-first defender. Not abundantly skilled with the puck but capable of making the safe, clean play and avoiding turnovers. A terrific rush defender who uses his feet and stick to force turnovers and dump-ins at the blueline, although not a remotely physical player. Not much of a presence in the offensive zone aside from sending point shots towards the net."
Jake Walman,Edmonton Oilers,Defence,A top-four offensive defenceman with a cannon of a shot and a willingness to use it. One of the few blueliners who routinely beats goalies with the traditional full-wind-up clapper but can also jump up in the play and get looks from closer to the net. A solid puck-mover in all three zones who’s comfortable carrying and passing the puck in transition and does so at a high volume. Defends reasonably well in his own zone but has trouble preventing opponents from gaining the blueline with possession of the puck. Not particularly physical and can be turnover prone as well.
Aleksander Barkov,Florida Panthers,Forward,"A superstar two-way centre who combines peerless shutdown abilities with terrific offensive ability. Big, sturdy, and strong off and on the puck, leverages all of his physical gifts to make life a  living hell for anybody trying to handle the puck anywhere near him. The best stick-checking forward in the game, blending stick-lifts, poke checks, and body contact to harass puck carriers into giving it up along the wall and in open ice. Unsurprisingly strong in the dot as well. Because of his smarts and offensive ability he’s almost always in the right place to disrupt plays and can turn defence into offence in a second with a clever pass out of a battle. Creates plenty of chances for his linemates by taking contested pucks from the wall and dishing them to the slot but looks to make the safe play up the wall to the defender if the lane isn’t open. A skilled puck handler in transition who can create rush offence himself if the opportunity presents itself but also makes linemates better by hitting them in stride in the neutral zone. A good scorer who uses his size to get inside position in the slot but undeniably a pass-first player."
Sam Reinhart,Florida Panthers,Forward,"An elite top-line scoring winger who combines almost unmatched scoring efficiency with incredible defensive play. His trademark goal is the one-timer from the hashmarks on a pass from behind the net, mostly on the powerplay as a bumper but often at even strength as well, but he’s no tap-in merchant. He can and does score from everywhere, taking his time and picking corners to beat goalies point-blank, including from unconventional spots on the ice. Not a high-volume shooter, and is just as adept a playmaker, using his vision to create give-and-goes and slip pucks across the slot. Plays one of the most efficient and high-I.Q. games in the league, fully aware of everything happening on the ice and able to make a brilliant first touch to improve the condition of the puck, extend a possession, or get himself in shooting position. Increasingly involved in transition, making up for his own lack of footspeed but slowing the play down and keeping defenders guessing to open up passing and shooting lanes, although he has no issue dumping the puck in and trusting his linemates to get to the puck and start a cycle sequence. A consistently superb defensive player, willing to engage physically without throwing bodychecks and using a sneaky stick to break up players with poke checks and stick lifts."
Sam Bennett,Florida Panthers,Forward,"A skilled top six checking centre whose versatility and creativity has made him a terrific utility player in his late 20s. Understandably known mostly for his physical presence, which has become considerable both during active play and between the whistles. Willing to victimize opponents with crushing bodychecks, especially in the corner of the offensive zone, and uses chasing down loose pucks as an opportunity to finish checks hard. As a result, takes a lot of minor penalties, mostly roughings and other infractions related to engaging body-to-body with opponents, not to mention the odd fighting major. However, the offensive skill for which he was drafted fourth overall is still there; he’s a skilled puck carrier in transition who uses above-average skill and excellent hands to navigate the neutral zone with possession of the puck. Once he crosses the blueline he can take on defenders one-on-one or funnel pucks to streaking linemates to create rush chances. During longer cycles, he works along the wall to extend possessions and set up point shots and crashes the net to make himself a target for passes and tips."
Anton Lundell,Florida Panthers,Forward,"A middle-six defence-first centre who plays a stabilizing complementary game. Not a puck-dominant player by any stretch but makes subtle, smart plays to advance the puck, avoid turnovers, and maintain possession. Plays a disruptive, pressuring role with an active stick to force turnovers, get the puck to a near-by linemate, and then crash the net. Upside comes from playmaking ability, an area in which he flashes high-end skill but doesn’t create at a high enough rate."
Brad Marchand,Florida Panthers,Forward,"A veteran playmaking pest. Has slowed down in recent years and isn’t quite the elite creator he once was, but still spends plenty of time with the puck in transition, displays great hands, and distributes the puck around the offensive zone. Has a good enough wrist shot to beat goalies from range but just as happy to muck about in the inner slot jumping on rebounds or getting open for short-range one-timers. Happy to do the dirty work in all three zones and is particularly strong at turning defence to offence quick, both by forcing turnovers and attacking with numbers and by retrieving loose pucks and making the smart play to navigate into the neutral zone."
Nico Sturm,Florida Panthers,Forward,"A bottom-six utility centre who plays a simple crash and bang game with most of his effort focused on chasing pucks, getting to the front of the net, and bashing at rebounds. A strong skater with solid size who wins faceoffs at one of the highest clips in the league, but otherwise quite limited."
Evan Rodrigues,Florida Panthers,Forward,
Matthew Tkachuk,Florida Panthers,Forward,"A star playmaking winger who blends high-end passing skill with a power forward style game.  Oftentimes looks like an agitating, net-crashing utility player when he’s forechecking, finishing checks, getting to the crease, and jamming at pucks in the inner slot, but combines that motor and sensibility with legitimate high-end ability to make his linemates better. Not as elegant or flashy a passer as some of his peers in the upper echelon of the league but gets the puck into the slot nonetheless, often with a defender leaning on him. His extreme lack of foot speed limits his ability to lead the rush himself but he makes up for it by working hard to recover pucks in both ends and initiate zone exits in the defensive zone to get the puck to his speedier teammates. Combine all that with a knack for driving his opponents crazy with between-whistle mischief, borderline legal physical plays, and chirping and you have a player well-suited to tight high-stakes hockey."
Carter Verhaeghe,Florida Panthers,Forward,
Aaron Ekblad,Florida Panthers,Defence,"A big, low-maintenance two-way defenceman who can handle heavy minutes and elevate his play as games tighten up. While he’s one of the slowest top-pair blueliners in the game and not particularly skilled as a puck-mover, he gains an edge using his size and elite physical strength to win battles in the net front and recover loose pucks along the wall with no-nonsense chip-outs. In the postseason, when mugging is more acceptable, his effectiveness defensively increases accordingly. Confident with the puck on his stick due to his immovability and often makes himself available for passes into the neutral zone (so he can get it deep). Offensive game mostly revolves around point shots but he is fond of jumping up in the play and can even sometimes be found screening the goalie or crashing the net."
Gustav Forsling,Florida Panthers,Defence,"A number one two-way defenceman with excellent mobility and a strong defensive stick. Covers a ton of space in the defensive zone, aggressively closing out and ambitiously disrupting plays looking a lot bigger than he actually is. Reads the play well and understands when he has enough support to make a risky play to force a turnover and is especially deadly on the back-check. Creativity with the puck quite a bit more limited, but carries it well, helps maintain offensive zone possession, and has a good point shot."
Seth Jones,Florida Panthers,Defence,"A big-minute two-way defender who can absorb a heavy and difficult workload in all situations. Solidly above-average in almost all aspects of the game even if he lacks the separating skill to be an high-end #1 defenceman. A strong and confident skater, especially with the puck on his stick, and willing to join the rush. Not a superb puck-mover, but gets the job done. Takes a lot of shots from the point, especially the centre lane, but doesn’t score at a particularly high rate. Without the puck, he’s active in his own end with a solid defensive stick and is willing to use his large frame. His Achilles heel since an ankle injury suffered before joining the Blackhawks has been backwards agility and it has consistently made him extremely vulnerable to rushing forwards, who often respond to his attempts to cut them off at the blueline by blowing right past him."
Niko Mikkola,Florida Panthers,Defence,
Quinton Byfield,Los Angeles Kings,Forward,"A developing playmaking two-way forward whose combination of speed, size, and skill gives him the potential to be a first-line centre. Flashes game-breaking ability with dynamic individual efforts that often involve forcing a turnover, turning on the jets, and deking first the defenceman and then the goalie. Can bully his way through contact and has a one-timer that explodes off his stick in the slot. A clever passer who connects on a lot of flashy no-look and backhand feeds to the slot. Has a high motor defensively and is eager to use is speed and size to break up plays and win loose and 50/50 pucks in his own end; it helps that he has a nice first touch out of battles and rarely makes a turn-over. Unlocking his upside will require translating time with the puck into dangerous scoring opportunities with more frequency; his highlight-reel plays show what happens when he trusts his tools and asserts his will. Philip Danault A top six two-way playmaking centre who provides a stabilizing presence while making the most of his time with the puck. Possesses a high hockey I.Q. that allows him to process his surroundings quickly and anticipate how plays will develop before the puck gets to him, allowing him to execute effective one-touch passing sequences, including by smacking 50/50 pucks directly to an open linemate. Understands when to push the pace with a quick feed but is equally comfortable handling the puck in the offensive zone and waiting for space to develop, and doesn’t force plays if they’re not there. Wins a lot of puck battles and works in his defensive zone to force mistakes and get the puck out of trouble. Very strong in the face-off dot."
Kevin Fiala,Los Angeles Kings,Forward,"A top-line winger with superb hands and the strength to handle the puck through congestion and towards the net. Attempts and executes absurd deking sequences, overcoming unexceptional footspeed using his hands and solid base to attack open space. Overpowers goalies with a devastating and accurate one-timer but can rip wrist shots from distance as well. Underrated as a defensive contributor, and he’s an active puck retriever who initiates the break-out and takes pucks off the wall cleanly."
Warren Foegele,Los Angeles Kings,Forward,
Adrian Kempe,Los Angeles Kings,Forward,"A speedy first line scoring winger who’s absolutely lethal in transition. Bullets through the neutral zone with a head of steam, forces defenders to back off, and then wires the puck into the net. While he’s got great hands and is fully capable of carrying the puck up-ice himself, he might be even more dangerous when he’s not the one handling it on the rush so he can focus on darting to open ice for a chance to get off his lethal catch-and-shoot wrister. Not a remarkable or anticipatory playmaker but solid at recognizing the options in front of him and executing the right play. A decent defensive player with the fun quirk to his game that when he’s covering for the defender in transition he becomes a deranged hip check machine."
Anze Kopitar,Los Angeles Kings,Forward,"A veteran two-way playmaking centre whose cerebral game has allowed him to contribute at a high level late into his 30s. His feet are slower than most of his opponents’ at this point, but his brain works much faster and it remains remarkable how patiently and expertly he controls the pace of play. His offensive hockey I.Q. mostly manifests in two ways: he recognizes how plays are going to develop before he gets the puck and can make precise no-look passes look easy, and he knows when to take extra time with the puck to allow a linemate to get where he needs them to end up. Similarly wise as a scorer, where he does not take a high volume of chances but sneaks to dangerous areas to strike. Clever in puck battles where he comes up with the puck at a high rate, a prolific puck thief, and active in his own zone as a disruptor and puck retriever."
Alex Laferriere,Los Angeles Kings,Forward,
Cody Ceci,Los Angeles Kings,Defence,"A veteran two-way depth defenceman whose solid skating ability has been unable to counter-act a decline in other areas of the game. Outside of the offensive zone, where he is a modest contributor who swings pucks to his defensive partner and occasionally jumps up in the play, he is extremely uninvolved with the puck, letting his partner chase down loose pucks in the defensive zone, rarely disrupting plays with his stick, and frequently getting walked by rushing wingers while trying to play a tight gap. While not a hitter, Ceci is willing to engage physically in front of the net and along the boards but doesn’t typically get the better of those matchups. May be able to provide some stability next to a talented puck-handler."
Drew Doughty,Los Angeles Kings,Defence,"A veteran two-way defenceman who still brings a stabilizing, puck-dominant presence in heavy minutes. Two constants throughout his career have been careful and high-level puck-moving and high-end awareness on both ends of the ice. One of the best defencemen in the league at recovering loose pucks in the defensive zone and turning them into clean exits because he’s constantly scanning and shoulder checking and recognizes the best option before the puck is on his stick. Considering how often he has the puck on his stick he rarely turns it over, even though he’s not afraid to fire a home-run stretch pass up ice to spring a rushing forward for a break. Has lost a step in his skating speed which makes urgency and effort even more consequential. A deliberate and methodical stick checker who plays mind games to shut-down odd man rushes and take the pass away, but can get burned by giving the puck carrier too much space to shoot. Has a great shot and likes to have the puck a lot at the point but isn’t that much of a difference-maker offensively at even strength anymore."
Brian Dumoulin,Los Angeles Kings,Defence,"A low-maintenance veteran defensive defenceman who capably protects his own zone. Unambitious with the puck but avoids turnovers and possesses an underrated first pass. Unexpectedly prolific at teeing up linemates for one-timers in the offensive zone, although he takes few point shots himself. Not often found battling for pucks along the boards or throwing crushing hits, but has a solid defensive stick."
Matt Boldy,Minnesota Wild,Forward,"A first line scoring winger with an enviable combination of scoring skill, strength on the puck, hands, and hockey I.Q. that make him extremely difficult to contain. Is utterly in his element on extended offensive zone cycle sequences where his puck protection skills, ability to read plays as they develop, awareness of where every one of his linemates is moving, skill for making the unexpected feed against the grain, and willingness to fire the puck from anywhere can lead to dazzling sequences. Buzzes around the zone looking like positions had never been invented, sprinting to wherever he’s most effective and being an absolute pest on the forecheck with a sensational defensive stick that allows him to poke away pucks and then win the battles that result quickly enough to get possessions back on track. That combined with a commitment to putting in work in the defensive zone to wins pucks and swiftly move them out of harm’s way gives him tremendous two-way upside."
Joel Eriksson Ek,Minnesota Wild,Forward,"A top six two-way centre who plays a simple and effective offensive game to complement excellent shut-down defence. Aggravates opponents by hounding them on the forecheck and using his big frame and active stick to win pucks along the wall. Not particularly active with the puck offensively, but makes smart simple plays and gets to where he needs to go in the slot to do the necessary dirty work of screening, tipping, jumping on rebounds, and providing a target for high-danger passes. Not an efficient scorer, but creates enough volume in tight to compensate for it."
Marcus Foligno,Minnesota Wild,Forward,
Kirill Kaprizov,Minnesota Wild,Forward,"A superstar playmaking winger who plays a dynamic and creative game on offence without sacrificing defence. Frequently pulls off jaw-dropping no-look spinarama passes that go tape-to-tape through multiple defenders, leaving them stunned. Sees plays that shouldn’t even be possible and executes flashy passes through skates and sticks at full speed (and often on the backhand that have little to no margin for error). Dekes past opponents by changing his angle of attack, often even turning his back to them and finding creative routes down the ice. Makes up for a lack of straight-line speed with shiftiness and agility and a lack of height with stockiness, strength on the puck, and motor. His transition game starts in the defensive zone where he is unparalleled in terms of involvement on zone exits, winning races to loose pucks and taking risks to leave with the puck on his stick. Has a terrific one-timer and great hand-eye but is a pass-first player and an opportunistic scorer who generates chances off of extended forechecking sequences."
Marco Rossi,Minnesota Wild,Forward,"A developing top six utility centre who fills in the blanks well and plays an impressive small-area game considering his lack of size. Drafted as a high-I.Q. playmaker but has relied more on the former quality than the latter, making do with fewer puck touches but supporting linemates in transition and getting to the front of the net. Still flashes strong passing ability but the primary aspect of his game now is cleverly navigating the dangerous areas of the ice and playing through contact -- no joke as a 5’9 centre -- to create dangerous chances. Responsible with the puck but has more to give."
Mats Zuccarello,Minnesota Wild,Forward,
Jonas Brodin,Minnesota Wild,Defence,A top-pairing shut-down defenceman
Brock Faber,Minnesota Wild,Defence,"A developing two-way puck-moving defenceman with terrific mobility, endurance, and stretch passing ability. A refined puck-retriever in his own zone who uses skating and strength to get loose pucks cleanly and create space to make the right play on the break-out. Aspires to be a top-tier play-killer while also protecting the slot, and can get himself into trouble misjudging when to attack the puck-carrier and when to hang back. At his best, he dictates the play defending the rush, luring opponents along the wall where he can close out and rub them out of the play while clogging escape routes; at his worst, he’s exploitable by top players who take advantage of the space he gives them or beat him to the outside when he goes for the home-run disruptive play. At his best, he creates waves of pressure in the defensive zone, forcing passes he can knock aside or chips off the boards he can retrieve; at his worst, he finds himself running around trying to solve everybody’s problems and inadvertently creating new ones. Nonetheless, his ability to deliver stretch passes and jump up in the play is undeniable, and while consistency has been an issue he undeniably has the tools to become a legitimate top pair or even number one defenceman."
Jared Spurgeon,Minnesota Wild,Defence,
Josh Anderson,Montreal Canadiens,Forward,"A hybrid scoring power forward and among the fastest skaters in the game whose weaknesses as a passer and defensive player make his style much more high-risk. Barrels down the ice, chases after pucks, and finishes his checks in the offensive zone. Despite breakaway speed, most of his goals come either from crashing the net for rebounds and one-timers or firing wrist shots from long distance. While not an absolutely incapable passer, his feet are certainly faster than his head and he rarely creates much for his linemates other than a bit of chaos. His puck pursuit does not often extend to the defensive zone, and when it does it’s often for the worse because he is quite prone to turning it over."
Nick Suzuki,Montreal Canadiens,Forward,"A skilled playmaking two-way centre first line. A puck-dominant player who acquires the puck through hard work in the defensive zone, with the hands to turn loose pucks and steals into clean exits and the mobility to carry it through the neutral zone. Can dish the puck across the seam off the rush or pick apart defences with clever one-timer set-ups from behind the net or across the slot. Very hesitant to shoot the puck himself but has added a tremendous finishing touch to his arsenal, beating goalies cleanly from range with a deceptive wrist shot release and picking corners with one-timers, especially on the powerplay. Has had issues in the past with offensive output and defensive commitment coming at the expense of one another, but has taken strides towards finding a strong balance with better possession play."
Cole Caufield,Montreal Canadiens,Forward,"A first line scoring winger who plays an exuberant and high-skill game limited by his diminutive size. His excellent wrist shot can beat goalies from range, and as a result he fires it from everywhere on the ice, especially the perimeter areas outside the slot. The same is true of his one-timer, which isn’t quite as strong and therefore is better used off cross-slot passes from his linemates -- he isn’t exactly a net-crasher but times his routes into the outer slot well and gets open to shoot on yawning cages. Similarly, he has great hands and is adept at navigating through defenders to get extra space to get his shot off. Still a clear shoot-first player but an increasingly capable playmaker who can find open linemates in dangerous areas and extend possessions by sending pucks to the point instead of just firing them. An extremely limited defensive player who’s not involved in his own end or on the forecheck, staying out of the fray and waiting for the puck to come to him."
Kirby Dach,Montreal Canadiens,Forward,"A developing playmaking centre with size and an enviable physical toolkit. Moves the puck up the ice with a strong skating stride and excellent hands, using his body to protect it, but has struggled to take the next step and turn those entries into scoring opportunities. Not a prolific shooter and when he does tally it’s generally because he put his big frame to use to get close to the net and either receive a quick pass or jump on a rebound off a scramble play. Sees the ice well and is a patient playmaker, confident enough to send lengthy cross-ice or stretch passes to his linemates. Possesses defensive upside due to his physical attributes but has been inconsistent in that area. Needs to get back on track following injuries."
Juraj Slafkovsky,Montreal Canadiens,Forward,"A developing power-forward. Uses his huge frame to battle for pucks, throw hits, and establish position in front of the net. Has a heavy shot that can beat goalies from distance, but just as willing to get to the ugly areas in front and muck around for rebounds and deflections. Crucially has displayed playmaking upside which if built upon would significantly raise his ceiling. For now he does set up linemates well, but his dangerous passes are typically more of the throw-the-puck-into-the-slot-and-see-what-happens than the kind of control that high-end passers show. Skates with below-average speed and is still working out how to connect the dots in transition between navigating the neutral zone and creating offence after crossing the blueline. Has a bad habit for playing with one hand on his stick when defending and trying (unsuccessfully) to get away with hooking and holding penalties while trying to backcheck hard, but he is involved and engaged physically. It remains to be seen whether he can develop into a play-driving all-around power forward or if he will ultimately be pigeon-holed as a skilled utility player."
Patrik Laine,Montreal Canadiens,Forward,"A sniping winger who can beat goalies from long-range. Whether it’s his punishing one-timer, which ranks among the hardest and most-used clappers in the league, or his equally challenging wrist shot, leaving him open from anywhere on the ice is a recipe for disaster. What separates him from the one dimensional distance shooters is an underrated and well-rounded offensive game; he has above-average speed and superb hands which allow him to navigate the neutral zone and create opportunities both for himself and his linemates off the rush. That playmaking will never be the focal point of his game but he’s not a single-minded shooter and moves the puck well, particularly in transition. All that said, the play does tend to funnel to the perimeter when he’s out there. He’s a harder worker defensively than he used to be, has a decent defensive stick, and is willing on occasion to use his body, but the way he creates offence combined with poor awareness without the puck tends to lead to poor outcomes regardless and he makes it tough for coaches to trust him."
Alex Newhook,Montreal Canadiens,Forward,"A developing offensive forward who can play centre or the wing. Pass-first, almost never shooting the puck from any area of the ice other than the slot. When he does put pucks on goal, though, they go in at an efficient clip on quick one-timers or opportunistic jumping on loose pucks. Shows some flashes of puck skills but doesn’t spend enough time with possession of it to drive play at a strong rate. Combo of foot speed and a decent stick could give him the tools to be a solid two-way player but it hasn’t yet translated."
Noah Dobson,Montreal Canadiens,Defence,"A top-pairing offensive defenceman who’s at his best when he’s active and ambitious with the puck. Likes to take shots from the point and is great at filtering them through for tips and rebounds but is much more dangerous when he jumps up in the play either by joining the rush or carrying the puck in tighter to create chances for himself or linemates. An adept puck-mover who moves his feet to create and exploit passing lanes in the offensive zone and is capable of delivering accurate stretch passes. Confident with the puck on his stick and opens up a lot of options in transition by threatening to carry it through the neutral zone, where he can even beat fellow defenders with dekes. A relatively lanky 6’4 who leaves something on the table physically and isn’t particularly strong in the net-front but isn’t afraid to race for loose pucks and battle along the wall. Exploitable off the rush where his gap is often way too aggressive or way too soft and can be caught looking a bit clueless losing track of where he’s meant to be and getting trapped behind the net. That said, he has the tools to be a competent in-zone defender, even if tilting the ice with the puck will likely remain his forté."
Lane Hutson,Montreal Canadiens,Defence,"A developing offensive defenceman who plays the game with creativity, deceptiveness, and ambition. Plays at a high pace but rarely in a straight line, using head and body fakes combined with agile feet to navigate the ice from end-board to end-board. Unafraid to get deep in the offensive zone along the boards and handle the puck, opening and scanning for passing and shooting lanes while defenders try to figure out who’s supposed to take him and keep up. Never stands still, walking the blueline with rapid cross-overs waiting for the defending winger to over-commit so he can dart towards the net and create a numerical advantage. Chases down pucks in the offensive zone to keep possession alive, stick checking and engaging on the boards. An excellent passer able to execute on the opportunities he opens up and deliver high-danger feeds across the zone like few defencemen. Solid in the defensive zone in areas where his agility and aggressiveness can manifest, like defending the blueline, angling rushers to the perimeter, and retrieving pucks, but urgency isn’t always there on in-zone sequences and his physical limitations become much more pronounced."
Mike Matheson,Montreal Canadiens,Defence,"A smooth-skating two-way defenceman capable of playing heavy and difficult minutes. Extremely visible all over the ice, his mobility and stamina lead him to cover more ground in all situations than almost any other blueliner, from pursuing forwards and chasing down pucks in the defensive zone to forcing turnovers to battling to carrying pucks with speed through the neutral zone. Not an especially creative player in the offensive zone but can walk the blueline and dish the puck from the centre lane, especially on the powerplay where he capably delivers tape to tape passes to flanking wingers. Otherwise, his offence mostly revolves his own shot, which goes in at a good rate and creates deflections and rebounds when it doesn’t. His desire to push the pace can have predictable defensive consequences, like his high-risk high-reward disruptive rush defence, his tendency to get out of position chasing down pucks, and his high turnover rate."
Kaiden Guhle,Montreal Canadiens,Defence,"A developing defence-first blueliner with excellent mobility and promise as a puck-mover. When he’s at his best, he uses his skating to proactively snuff out plays early and keep opponents away from prime real estate. Uses his size to absorb contact along the boards, battle for pucks, and throw hits. Has a solid first pass and is strong on the puck, but can be prone to turnovers when moving from defence to offence. Wants to be involved at both ends of the ice and occasionally ventures deep into the offensive zone, joining the rush. Has all the tools to be a premier shutdown defenceman who can chip in offensively."
Filip Forsberg,Nashville Predators,Forward,"A shoot-first star winger with superb hands and a high-end all-around skillset. Shoots the puck from everywhere in the zone because he can pick corners from long-range. Uses his puck-handling skills to take the puck from the perimeter to the hashmarks, with a curl and drag pucks release that gives him extra space and deceptiveness. Has the patience to make the extra move to beat a goalie instead of throwing the puck on net. Not all finesse, and can bully his way to the net-front and get to garbage goals as well. Not a particularly speedy player but doesn’t need a lot of strides to get where he wants to and has generally been a difference-maker in transition as a result. At his best, is a dedicated puck hound who kills possessions in all three zones and turns steals into offensive opportunities for him and his linemates. No slouch as a playmaker, recognizing openings in the offensive zone quickly and sending the puck to the perimeter to keep in-zone sequences alive."
Jonathan Marchessault,Nashville Predators,Forward,"A veteran scoring winger. An opportunistic scorer who gets to the net and hangs out in the slot or at the back door to tap in high-danger passes and jam in garbage goals. Not a high-volume playmaker but moves the puck with flair and confidence in tight areas. Poor footspeed limits his ability to control the game off the rush or win races to loose pucks, and combines with his lack of size to increasingly be an issue defensively, but he remains smart enough to support linemates in transition. Ryan O’Reilly"
Erik Haula,Nashville Predators,Forward,A veteran defensive centre who at his best provides a stabilizing presence including chip outs of his own zone and efficiency winning battles both along the wall and in the faceoff dot. Offers some offensive upside by crashing the net. Takes a lot of stick infractions and doesn’t handle the puck enough to draw many.
Steven Stamkos,Nashville Predators,Forward,"A veteran scoring forward with a powerful one-timer who does most of his work off the puck. Hockey I.Q. remains intact and he still moves around the ice pretty well, which allows him to get in position to power home one-timers or find holes around a goalie’s leg pads to whip in wrist shots. Relies upon linemates to do the work in transition and in the defensive zone but possesses underrated playmaking skill that keeps him from being a pure trigger-man; nonetheless, not a line driver at this point in his career."
Roman Josi,Nashville Predators,Defence,"A veteran offensive defenceman with elite skill in transition and the ability to thrive with an extremely heavy workload with the puck in all three zones. One of the most active blueliners in the league, quarterbacking his team’s offence on in-zone possessions and leading the rush as well. Poise and patience are the keys to his offensive game, as he lacks the straight-ahead speed of most of his transition-dominant peers, but his ability to not only dish the puck accurately to a streaking winger but also receive a pass from his partner in the neutral zone and establish offensive zone possession keeps opponents honest. A confident and capable loose puck retriever, but prefers to let his partner fight those battles so he can get that extra step up ice. Clever at walking the offensive blueline to sift through wrist shots but has no qualms about absolutely hammering a slap shot from the point. An elite playmaker who sees the ice extremely well and executes at a high level."
Brady Skjei,Nashville Predators,Defence,"A veteran two-way defenceman with solid physical tools including size and mobility. Covers ground quickly and protects the puck well, skills he uses to lead zone entries and retrieve pucks in the defensive zone, but of which he’s capable of executing at a high rate. Doesn’t have the prettiest skating stride but his straight-ahead speed is solid; his agility is not great, though, and when he loses track of the play in the defensive zone opponents can exploit this weakness and leave him chasing and wagging his stick around ineffectively. His reach is good but his ability to actually shut down passing lanes is inconsistent. Boasts a heavy and accurate point shot as well as decent passing ability."
Jesper Bratt,New Jersey Devils,Forward,"A star rushing winger who pushes the play and flies up the ice in transition, forcing opposing defenders to back off and taking advantage of the space to beat goalies cleanly or force them to move side-to-side with high-danger passes. While his bread and butter is undeniably the rush, where he ranks as one of the most prolific creators of offence in the game, Bratt also has a terrific one-timer and isn’t afraid to go to the net-mouth to stuff in ugly goals either, especially with the man advantage. Not a total liability defensively, but not one to engage in the dirty areas of the ice or get much involved unless the opportunity for a counter-attack presents itself."
Jack Hughes,New Jersey Devils,Forward,"An elite playmaking centre, one of the most talented players in the game. Boasts spectacular puck skills that allow him to spend more time with possession than almost anybody else in the NHL, whether he’s creatively navigating his way through the neutral zone, taking on defenders one-on-one, weaving around opponents in the offensive zone, driving the puck to the net, or feeding his linemates, everything he does with control has layers of deception and skill. Buzzes around without the puck, stealing it off opponents and putting in the work to get it back on the right side of the ice, but is unavoidably affected by his size and stature both in terms of durability, ability (and willingness) to engage physically, and capability of winning even a respectable share of his faceoffs. Has had difficulty remaining healthy."
Timo Meier,New Jersey Devils,Forward,"A skilled scoring winger with a nose for the net who produces a vast quality of shots in tight off of extended offensive zone possession, especially with the man advantage. Uses a sturdy frame and above-average speed to carry the puck in transition, protect it from opposing defenders, and get to the dangerous areas of the offensive zone. Soft hands which he uses to manipulate defencemen and make clever bang-bang passes across the slot. Can get caught deep in the zone on counter-attacks and turns the puck over at a fairly high rate, but generally is a strong possession player and a hard worker in the defensive zone."
Dawson Mercer,New Jersey Devils,Forward,"A developing scoring winger who does almost all of his damage from within a few feet of the net. Doesn’t create a large volume of scoring chances but finishes at an efficient rate. Similarly, while not blessed with exceptional playmaking ability he’ll make the odd crafty feed across the slot that would hint at a higher upside to his game. Can chip in on the forecheck, chasing down dump-ins and rebounds, but doesn’t play physically or engage too much along the boards. Has some skill in transition but turns the puck over a lot."
Stefan Noesen,New Jersey Devils,Forward,"A veteran net-front two-way winger who plays a hard-nosed game chasing and battling for pucks in the slot and along the boards. A slow and graceless skater, but isn’t expected to do much with the puck other than dump it in or out and jam at it in the crease. That said, he’s an underrated passer in tight who despite not creating a high quantity of shots with his playmaking does move it well across the slot. His simple game transfers to the powerplay as well."
Ondrej Palat,New Jersey Devils,Forward,"A veteran utility winger who despite losing pretty much all of his footspeed in the past few seasons continues to be one of the more effective complementary two-way players in the game. Whether it’s working in the defensive zone to make the smart play to chip the puck out of make a clean pass, engage along the boards or on the forecheck, chase down loose pucks in either zone, or make simple continuation plays in the offensive zone to maintain possession, what he lacks in flash and offensive dominance he makes up for in subtle effectiveness."
Dougie Hamilton,New Jersey Devils,Defence,"A top-pairing offensive defenceman with a bomb of a shot that he uses at every opportunity, whether from the point or closer to the net. Willing to leap up in the play and make himself open for high-danger one-timer passes. Helps maintain offensive zone possession by getting pucks through traffic and deeper into the zone. A solid puck-mover in transition who can dish the puck in the offensive zone, but much prefers to put it on goal whenever possible. Doesn’t use his size to throw hits or battle along the boards or in front of the net, and takes far too many frustrating infractions while drawing next to none himself. An awkward and slow skater. Not a prolific rush defender, but uses his long stick to force dump-ins and protect the middle of the ice. Despite his vastness, blocks fewer shots than any defenceman in the league."
Luke Hughes,New Jersey Devils,Defence,"A developing offensive defenceman who skates faster than any other blueliner in the league and spends plenty of time with the puck on his stick. Moves the puck well in transition, drawing penalties with his creative puck control. While he hardly ever throws a body check, he works hard when he doesn’t have the puck, battling along the boards, chasing down loose pucks, and disrupting plays with his stick. An unfortunate side effect of this is that he gets targeted by opposing checkers a lot. In the offensive zone he’s demonstrated quality and efficient playmaking and flashed serious skills with the man advantage."
Simon Nemec,New Jersey Devils,Defence,"A developing offensive defenceman who has shown early indications of an efficient game with the puck. Prefers to move the puck up the ice with possession, and while he doesn’t boast the fastest straight-line speed in the league he’s agile and deceptive. This also allows him to navigate the offensive zone and get to more dangerous areas, a strategy which made his shots among the most dangerous among blueliners as a rookie, even though he scored on few of them. His shot was a strength as a prospect, and given his ability to create quality chances this could raise his offensive ceiling. Play without the puck was more of a challenge, but despite throwing almost no checks and struggling to handle on-coming traffic off the rush he at least showed a willingness to engage physically along the boards."
Brett Pesce,New Jersey Devils,Defence,"A top four defensive defenceman who focuses on protecting the slot at 5-on-5 and the penalty kill. Plays an aggressive and effective prevent-defence style against the rush, using smart positioning and an effective stick to defend the blueline and force dump-ins and turnovers. Similarly closes off passing lanes and shuts down opponents’ attempts to penetrate the slot with high-danger feeds. Doesn’t chase hits or retrievals in his own end and makes the safe and successful chip-off-the-glass play more often than not. Conversely, is one of the league’s more prolific blueliners when it comes to entering the zone, and while he dumps it in plenty he’s not opposed to making a play himself to establish possession. After that, it’s a simple pucks on net game."
Mathew Barzal,New York Islanders,Forward,"A top line playmaking winger whose dazzling speed, hands, and creativity make him one of the most dynamic offensive players in the game. Can win a footrace against almost any player in the league and blazes through the neutral zone, deftly navigating around defenders and protecting the puck without sacrificing speed and control. Makes taking the puck from end to end, around the net, and back out into the top of the zone look almost easy. Spends a ton of time in the offensive zone with the puck on his stick, circling and protecting and scanning for a passing target. He’s generally reluctant to just get to the slot and shoot the puck himself, and the greatest defect in his game is that he too-often settles for the safety valve of a low-to-high or drop pass to a defenceman or forward hanging out on the perimeter, which often seems like a waste after the lengthy adventure he took getting the puck to that spot in the first place. He’s at his best when he plays with a shooter who gets to soft areas in the high slot or back-door, and he’s capable of making some absolutely jaw-dropping feeds if given the right target. He turns the puck over at a very low rate but you sometimes wish he was willing to take a few more risks for higher-upside plays. The defensive play is less reliable, as sometimes his stick-checking, end-to-end theatrics, and contentious possession play keep things safely out of danger and sometimes he’s a bit less attentive and not as physically-engaged as he could be."
Jonathan Drouin,New York Islanders,Forward,"A complementary playmaking winger. After struggling as a play-driver, was able to better use his crafty passing ability as more of a utility player, managing the puck more conservatively and focusing on advancing the play to his linemates instead of trying to do more himself. Uses short one-timer set-ups to change the angle and get goalies moving, and while the rushes and dazzling dekes that seemed like his bread and butter have mostly left his game the result is a more focused and productive impact."
Anthony Duclair,New York Islanders,Forward,"A middle-six scoring winger who uses high-end straight line speed to dart to open ice, receive passes, and finish. Doesn’t spend much time with the puck himself but gets to dangerous areas for one-timers and catch-and-shoot rushes. Flashes high-danger passing ability but isn’t possession-dominant enough to use it frequently. Creates a high volume of breakaways and has slick hands at top speed that lead to highlight-reel goals, but the same all-out attacking mindset leads to a dereliction of his defensive responsibilities and cancels out much of his contributions."
Simon Holmstrom,New York Islanders,Forward,A middle-six scoring two-way winger
Bo Horvat,New York Islanders,Forward,
Anders Lee,New York Islanders,Forward,
Jean-Gabriel Pageau,New York Islanders,Forward,
Tony DeAngelo,New York Islanders,Defence,
Alex Romanov,New York Islanders,Defence,
Adam Pelech,New York Islanders,Defence,
Will Cuylle,New York Rangers,Forward,"A developing physical winger with offensive upside. Throws crushing body-checks, sometimes crossing the line into questionable territory, and willing to answer the bell. Boasts above-average speed which allows him to get breakaways and win races to pucks at both ends of the ice. A solid net-front presence with great hand-eye coordination for deflections. Takes a lot of shots from outside the slot because he’s got a rangy wrist shot that can beat goalies from the hashmarks and beyond. Not much of a passer at this point and doesn’t spend much time with the puck."
Alexis Lafreniere,New York Rangers,Forward,"A developing offensive winger with a nose for the net and a high hockey I.Q. that allows him to cleverly time his routes to the dangerous areas of the ice and get clear looks. Drafted as a playmaker, and increasingly comfortable making quick passes through the slot with limited time and space as well as handling the puck in transition. Often enters the offensive zone with possession of the puck and makes a saucer pass to a streaking linemate. Has terrific hands and is gaining the confidence to take advantage of them. A non-factor defensively with some physical upside."
J.T. Miller,New York Rangers,Forward,"A first-line centre who plays a fast, physical, playmaking style. Reads the play at an elite level, knowing where he wants to pass the puck before he receives it and keeping it on his blade for as little time as possible before advancing it to a better spot. His trademark play is a one-touch pass, and while that can occasionally lead to him over-use the points instead of getting pucks to the slot, that swift puck movement makes shots from the outside more dangerous. Uses his solid, stocky frame along the boards to assert position and get pucks off the wall cleanly. A rare power-forward/playmaker hybrid who plays with an ultra-competitive edge which when combined with his speed can lead to heavy clean hits and on occasion less legal physical plays as well."
Artemi Panarin,New York Rangers,Forward,"An elite playmaking winger with nearly unmatched patience and creativity with the puck on his stick in the offensive zone. Equally dangerous creating offence in transition and off sustained possessions, where he manipulates defenders and changes the tempo to open up passing lanes and find targets across the slot. This extends to his shot, as while his release is superb in its own right he increases its effectiveness by preceding it with subtle and deceptive moves and aiming for unexpected spots on the net; as a result, he scores a lot from distance with wrist shots, often through traffic. The more of a dual threat he is, the more space he has to work with, which snowballs into gaudy production. A prolific transition player despite a lack of straight-ahead footspeed and turns the puck over at a low rate relative to how much time he spends with it. One of the least physical players in hockey, staying out of the fray and letting others chase down and fight for pucks. Defensive impact amounts to opportunistically flipping from defence to offence."
Vincent Trocheck,New York Rangers,Forward,"A playmaking centre with a well-rounded game. Capable of operating as a shooter, a playmaker, or both, and that versatility makes him an easy fit with talented linemates. Above-average skating helps him drive play off the rush, where he has a knack for weaving his way into the offensive zone before targeting a linemate with plenty of space to get a quality shot off. But his willingness to go to dangerous areas of the ice (both along the boards and in front of the net) make him a valuable asset on extended cycling sequences as well; it helps that he not only makes himself available for passes to the slot but is also one of the league’s better point shot deflectors. A better finishing touch would certainly help, but his volume keeps his production solid. Elsewhere he plays a gritty and capable defensive game focused on forcing the issue by pressuring the puck."
Mika Zibanejad,New York Rangers,Forward,"A playmaking top line centre who distributes the puck efficiently and with plenty of flair. Despite not creating nearly as much volume offensively at 5-on-5 as one would expect given his production, his passes are deceptive and often quite elegant, including sneaky backhand feeds to streaking recipients at the top of the circle, passes from behind the net, or short-range looks that change the angle just enough to get past the goalie. His trademark hyper-efficient finishing ability from distance has become more inconsistent of late, and while he’s still a devotee to the one-timer most of his even strength scoring has come off of bang-bang plays closer to the net lately rather than snipes. He works hard in his own end to regain the puck and has an excellent defensive stick which has made him a trusted penalty killer."
Adam Fox,New York Rangers,Defence,"A superstar two-way defenceman who plays the game with sparkling intelligence at both ends of the ice. Despite lacking size, speed, and physicality, controls the game with and without the puck. One of the best puck-moving defencemen in the NHL, making passes out of his own end of an extremely high calibre and with unmatched precision. No defencemen makes fewer mistakes or turnovers relative to the amount of plays he makes with the puck; whether it’s retrievals, simple break-out plays, or stretch passes setting up streaking wingers for odd-man rushes, he’s totally dependable. Dominant with the puck in the offensive zone where he joins the rush, jumps up in the play off the cycle to scramble defences and make cross-slot passes, and sends pucks from the right point to tee up open one-timers in the left-circle or the left point. The only thing missing from his offensive game is a heavy point shot; he has little interest in taking low-percentage one-timers and what pucks he does put on net from distance are mostly designed for deflections and rebounds. But he is still a high-efficiency scorer because he’s got an accurate wrist shot and is willing to get to more dangerous areas of the ice. He’ll never be a checker or stocky net-front defender, but a strong defensive stick and positioning more than compensate and make him a complete two-way player."
Vladislav Gavrikov,New York Rangers,Defence,
Braden Schneider,New York Rangers,Defence,"A developing two-way defenceman with a mix of physicality and mobility. Still putting the pieces together but has shown a willingness to do the legwork in the defensive zone to get to loose pucks and turn them into counter-attacks and has a strong first pass, which is already improving. One of the league’s most prolific shot-blockers, which points to a bigger role on the penalty kill in the future."
Michael Amadio,Ottawa Senators,Forward,"A hard-working and understatedly skilled utility winger who chases and battles for loose pucks while contributing some puck-moving and net-crashing. Can move up and down the lineup, playing a straightforward chip-and-chase role to kill time on a checking line or filling in the blanks and retrieving pucks for more skilled middle-six linemates."
Drake Batherson,Ottawa Senators,Forward,"A top six playmaking winger who’s especially adept at setting up linemates with cross-crease feeds and knocking in centre-lane onetimers on the powerplay. A solid all-around offensive player who flashes the skill of an even better one. His hands around the net are special and he has the patience to get the goalie down and out before putting the puck past him. A one-time threat but similarly will take the extra second to make sure he picks the right spot. He can make the safe pass to support linemates in transition but will occasionally make a dazzling play to the slot. His physical tools have improved through his career as well, especially his skating, although his defensive impact is limited."
Dylan Cozens,Ottawa Senators,Forward,"A developing scoring centre who has struggled with consistency as he works to become a high-end top six pivot. Willing to use his size to battle for pucks along the wall and strip opponents, but despite an increasing defensive role is still working on preventing scoring chances when he’s on the ice. When he’s on, he’s a premier puck carrier in transition with superb hands who puts the puck in the net both off of grimy plays in the slot and by beating goalies clean off the rush with a wrist shot. When he’s not, he struggles to create quality chances at an above-average rate."
Claude Giroux,Ottawa Senators,Forward,"A veteran playmaking winger who provides a stabilizing and complementary presence. Recovers loose pucks and finds linemates in dangerous areas. A keen passer in transition who makes the short, simple plays to advance the puck up-ice and creates lots of two-on-one and three-on-two opportunities. Not a volume shooter but gets to the right spots on the ice and has a nice finishing touch on those rush chances. Generally provides the defensive conscience that allows his linemates to make riskier plays and doesn’t expose his team to the downsides that can sometimes come from playing such a rush-based game."
Ridly Greig,Ottawa Senators,Forward,A developing utility winger who works hard and plays with a physical edge that helps him push play in the right direction. Still developing as an offensive contributor but has a bit of skill with the puck and a willingness to crash the net and take punishment. Not a blazingly fast skater and crosses the line of legality extremely frequently.
David Perron,Ottawa Senators,Forward,"A veteran third line winger who has significantly simplified his game in his mid-30s. One of the slowest skaters in the game and no longer spends a lot of time with the puck, focusing instead on providing a physical presence and battling for loose pucks along the wall and in front of the net. Will still on occasion show flashes of playmaking skill and scoring touch, especially when more space is available on the man advantage. Does enough subtle work with and without the puck to remain a positive contributor but by no means a driver at this point in his career. Tim Stützle An extremely skilled developing playmaking centre with quick feet and superb ability with the puck. Spends lots of time with the puck on his stick and navigates through the neutral zone challenging opponents and using his hands and agility to beat defenders one-on-one. The question through his young career has been translating this obvious ability into scoring opportunities and production, and while this isn’t a finished product he has shown undeniable flashes of both. He can see and execute highlight reel passes that most players wouldn’t dream of, and scores gorgeous goals using his hands to weave his way towards the net or to initiate give-and-go plays that leave him with a tap-in. More consistency and volume would allow him to reach his sky-high ceiling. While he’s a great puck thief and unafraid to finish checks, he can tend to stay a bit above the fray and get stuck in his own end defensively. Notoriously one of the best penalty drawers in the league; whether that’s due to his skill with the puck or more nefarious methods is in the eye of the beholder."
Brady Tkachuk,Ottawa Senators,Forward,"A top-line scoring winger who creates shot volume from all over the ice like almost nobody else in the game. While it’s easy to pigeonhole him as a net-front grinder, and he certainly is one of the most prolific creators of opportunities tight to the net off of rebounds, deflections, scramble plays, and whatever else he can get his hands on, he’s just as dangerous off the rush where his no-nonsense walk in and wire it approach leads to piles of shots and plenty of goals as well. Offers proof that you don’t need great foot speed or elite puck skills to be a problem in transition. Has developed a positive passing game as well, with finesse feeds on odd-man rushes and shovel-it-to-the-slot-where-I-know-there-are-guys prayers on extended possessions. Always eager to head to the corners to recover loose pucks, in no small part because it gives him the opportunity to finish his checks. That aggressiveness leads him to spend lots of time in the penalty box, for dropping the gloves, roughing, interference, etc., but while he’s one of the most penalized players in the league he does nonetheless draw more than he takes. Nobody would accuse him of lazy play anywhere on the ice, but his defensive impact is generally poor as he gets caught deep in the zone, trades rush chances, and turns the puck over by making uncontrolled plays."
Fabian Zetterlund,Ottawa Senators,Forward,A scoring winger who likes to shoot the puck from the perimeter despite scoring almost all of his goals close to the net. Uses above-average speed to create odd-man rushes and breakaways and frequently gets open for one-timers in the outer slot and near the circles. Reasonably strong in transition and protects the puck well. Willing to play with some physicality and has a solid build to battle for pucks but otherwise a limited defender.
Thomas Chabot,Ottawa Senators,Defence,"A top pairing offensive defenceman with good wheels and hands who jumps up in the play off the rush and within the offensive zone. After years playing enormous minutes and carrying a massive burden with the puck has had some discomfort adjusting and is particularly struggling to create as many opportunities for his linemates as before, but the skill is still present when he carries the puck in from the point and locates an open target along the slot. More the type to jump up and receive a break-out pass from his partner than fire one himself. Has never been a great defender but has improved in that area, with an effective stick and less carelessness with the puck."
Nick Jensen,Ottawa Senators,Defence,"A veteran defensive defenceman who at his best provides stability, mobility, and puck-moving in a top four role. Not a particularly physical player and absorbs a lot of pain as he is one of the most frequently-hit players in the game. While that can’t be pleasant, it may at least be some comfort that he rarely takes penalties while drawing them quite often. Uses his skating to retrieve pucks in the defensive zone and is capable of exiting the zone either by transporting the puck himself or facilitating his partner doing the same. Protects the middle of the ice defending the rush instead of playing a tight gap to snuff out entries. Has the puck skills to be a contributor in the offensive zone but is also willing to step back and play the safety blanket role instead."
Jake Sanderson,Ottawa Senators,Defence,"A #1 two-way defender whose mobility, defensive stick, and puck-moving ability have made him a steady play-driving presence at even strength. An excellent skater whose speed and acceleration is almost unmatched across the league, helping him win races to loose pucks and get back on defence when necessary. Shoulders a heavy defensive zone workload and holds up extremely well, disrupting plays off the rush and blocking passes with an active stick and turning retrievals into clean zone exits like few others in the league. Not physical in the least, although he’s not afraid to engage for the puck. Equally comfortable carrying the puck through the neutral zone or sending stretch passes up the ice, and keeps his heads up to spring odd-man rushes. The next step will be for him to become more of a difference-maker in the offensive zone; while his contribution tilting the ice is obvious, more production will follow when he becomes a more assertive chance creator, and we’ve seen flashes of what that looks like when he says screw it and takes the puck to the net himself."
Artem Zub,Ottawa Senators,Defence,"A top-four defensive defenceman and penalty killer. Plays a simple and efficient game focused on limiting the time and space of opposing forwards, especially on the rush where his defensive stick forces opponents to dump the puck into the corners where his linemate can retrieve it. Despite slow skating, rarely gets caught up-ice or surrenders an odd-man rush opportunity. When forced to, can make a solid first pass and rarely turns the puck over even relative to how little he has the puck, but is much happier letting his linemate worry about that."
Sean Couturier,Philadelphia Flyers,Forward,
Travis Konecny,Philadelphia Flyers,Forward,"A first line playmaking winger who excels at creating offence off the rush. Creates tons of chances in transition, using his acceleration to get behind the defence and whip accurate curl-and-drag wrist shots past goalies. Deadly short-handed as a result. Exceptional hands allow him to take unconventional routes through the neutral and offensive zone and leave defenders in the dust. A high-skill passer whose uses a masterful understanding of the rush game to manipulate defenders and timing to open up and exploit passing lanes across the slot. Teases defenders before floating saucer passes over their sticks or slipping pucks through the triangle. Won’t hesitate to blow the zone early if he smells an opportunity, with the attendant defensive consequences that come from playing such an aggressive run-and-gun game. Has the motor and stick to theoretically contribute defensively in the right role but that would likely blunt his offensive value."
Tyson Foerster,Philadelphia Flyers,Forward,
Matvei Michkov,Philadelphia Flyers,Forward,
Owen Tippett,Philadelphia Flyers,Forward,
Trevor Zegras,Philadelphia Flyers,Forward,"A creative playmaking forward who can play wing or centre (albeit with miserable faceoff efficiency) whose best attributes are finding open linemates in the slot and taking on opposing defenders one-on-one. An efficient finisher due to a knack for making himself open for cross-seam passes as well, but doesn’t shoot the puck enough to put up big goal totals. Quite turnover-prone, unsurprising given how high-leverage his game is. Foot speed and physicality both grade out well below-average."
Jamie Drysdale,Philadelphia Flyers,Defence,
Travis Sanheim,Philadelphia Flyers,Defence,"A big-minute offensive defenceman blessed with the combination of size and mobility coaches dream of. Between his elite straight-line speed and long reach, covers an enormous amount of ground and moves around the ice more than almost any other blueliner, especially impressive given his heavy minutes burden. Has taken the number one role as a green light to do absolutely everything. Jumps up in the offensive zone at every conceivable opportunity whether to pounce on a rebound, rush into the corner, grab a puck on the half-wall to feed across the crease, step into a high slot one-timer, take the puck around the net, or even screen the goalie. Defensively, he’s an aggressive disruptor with an active stick that he uses to kill plays at the line, block passing lanes, and win battles. Give him runway to lead the rush and he will take it without hesitation (his transition passing is less strong than his puck-carrying and he does still have some chip-off-the-glass habits). If he could play every position himself, he would. These adventures, perhaps unsurprisingly, can leave his linemates covering for him on counter-attack chances or stuck on an island in the zone when he’s gone for a home run play, and his high turnover rate doesn’t help."
Rasmus Ristolainen,Philadelphia Flyers,Defence,
Sidney Crosby,Pittsburgh Penguins,Forward,"A superstar veteran playmaking centre who has extended his generational dominance well into his 30s. Remains one of the absolute best passers in the sport, creating an elite quantity and quality of chances for his linemates with a vast arsenal of tools. Uses his trademark backhand pass while shielding the puck in the trapezoid, across the slot, or while shielding the puck on the half wall and waiting for the trailer to arrive with speed. Owns the ice before the goal line, winning puck battles with his superb strength or emerging from behind the net to swing a pass to a linemate at the back door. Often shields the puck on the half boards and sends perfect feeds up to a streaking trailer at the top of the zone, often with his trademark backhand. Still makes jaw-dropping no-look feeds, one-handed passes, and one-touch set-ups. Has not meaningfully regressed in any sense offensively in the past few seasons, even maintaining his footspeed. Doesn’t carry the puck as much himself and prefers the patient play rather than taking on defenders one-on-one compared to when he was younger. Gets to dangerous areas of the ice to make himself available for one-timers, one-legged tips and tap-ins, rebound jam plays, incredible deflections, and no-angle shots, but has no issue beating goalies with more straightforward wrist and snap shots either. Rightfully celebrated for his ridiculous edges and strength on the puck, which remain world class. Elite in the faceoff circle and has the skillset to play strong defence when called upon but makes sacrifices to generate offence."
Evgeni Malkin,Pittsburgh Penguins,Forward,"A veteran playmaking winger who still plays the game with plenty of flair and elite skill. Can’t push the pace like he once did but controls the puck immaculately and shows superb awareness of where his linemates are and how to find them in open ice. Dishes impossibly slick backhand passes to the middle of the ice. Remains one of the league’s premier puck thieves and can take the puck from an opponent’s stick cleanly to his own teammate’s blade in seconds. Otherwise doesn’t use his size as much anymore and lets linemates do most of the dirty work, although he still does take too many retaliatory penalties. One of the most pass-first players in hockey, and when he does shoot it’s generally in tight. Never a brilliant defender but has regressed further as speed and motor have declined."
Thomas Novak,Pittsburgh Penguins,Forward,"A skilled middle-six offensive winger with a ton of creativity with the puck. Not the fastest player, light for his frame, and will never throw the body but is so good and quick with his stick that he’s effective on the wall anyway because he can cleanly separate opponents from the puck with stick lifts and pokes. Capable of initiating and executing extended passing sequences, carrying the puck in transition, and beating defenders and goalies with his hands. A terrific and deceptive playmaker who finds linemates in the slot from behind the net and opens passing lanes by skating with the puck. An efficient finisher as well. Some inconsistency and struggles in the dot have kept him down the lineup."
Rickard Rakell,Pittsburgh Penguins,Forward,"A complementary top six scoring winger who finds soft areas of the ice in the slot and rewards playmaking linemates for finding him there. Has a quick release and a knack for putting shots in unexpected places to beat goalies. Otherwise around league-average in most areas including skating and passing, although he can execute the odd feed from behind the net to the net-front. Displays good hands in tight but does not spend much time with the puck on his stick. Brings a little underrated physicality but not involved in his own end."
Bryan Rust,Pittsburgh Penguins,Forward,"A complementary top six scoring winger. In addition to being willing to go to the slot and receive passes from skilled linemates, has developed underrated puck skills of his own that allow him to beat defenders to the outside in transition, protect the puck while swinging towards the net, and beat goalies with patience. Capable of finishing from medium range but does most of his damage in tight with plenty of rebounds, deflections, and wraparounds. Will never be mistaken for an elite playmaker but can read plays as they develop and execute one-touch passing sequences well. Once a tenacious forechecker but that aspect of his game has eroded as he’s become a go-to offensive player to the detriment of his defensive impact; nonetheless he is an active player in his own end  who uses his speed to win pucks and initiate zone exits."
Anthony Mantha,Pittsburgh Penguins,Forward,"A two-way big-bodied utility winger who subverts expectations with swift (if inelegant) skating and a lack of physicality. Strong scoring upside but not a dominant chance creator by any stretch. Pushes play in the right direction with subtle possession-extending plays with the puck, including passes in transition and around the perimeter of the offensive zone."
Erik Karlsson,Pittsburgh Penguins,Defence,"A veteran top-pairing pure offensive defenceman who remains as magically gifted with the puck as he is a liability without it. Remains one of the truly-elite puck-movers in the sport, pushing the puck up-ice with brilliant stretch passes or carrying it out of the defensive zone in full flight. Dominates the offensive zone, keeping the puck on his stick and shifting around the blueline scanning for a passing option or shooting lane, setting up one-timers, high-danger opportunities, and deflections while scoring at a solid clip himself. When these offensive zone adventures are compromised he does too-often take a wild stab at keeping them alive and end up getting caught in the dust. His defensive issues include excessive risk-taking with the puck, a lack of agility skating backwards without the puck, inexplicable defensive zone positioning, and losing focus and track of what’s happening around him in the defensive end. That’s not to say he doesn’t do anything well defensively however -- he’s got a solid stick and is a very active puck retriever who uses his hands to navigate out of trouble very effectively."
Kris Letang,Pittsburgh Penguins,Defence,A veteran offensive defenceman
Macklin Celebrini,San Jose Sharks,Forward,"A developing dynamic top line centre with two-way superstar potential. Combines eye-popping offensive skill with an unmatched motor and dogged desire to pursue the puck and make things happen all over the ice. Uses quick feet, agility, and sensational hands to drive the middle in transition, reading the play at top speed and processing how best to turn an entry into a scoring chance. Strong on the puck and not afraid to turn his back to the defender to gain that extra second. Boasts a wicked wrist shot that punishes any defenceman who gives him space to get it off, a hammer of a one-timer, an endless bag of tricks on breakaways, and soft hands around the net, adding make him a threat to score from anywhere in the zone. Uses his athleticism and fitness to never stop moving for entire shifts with and without the puck, circling the offensive zone, picking the right time to crash the net or rush to the back door, and quarterbacking the play from anywhere. On extended cycling sequences, uses the centre of the ice above the circles as a runway to attack the middle, get the puck to a winger on his flank for a one-timer, or simply wire a shot from distance himself. Makes life easy for his linemates by constantly moving to open spots, calling for the puck, and then carrying it where he can get it back to them in better condition. Understands the value of deception and combines it with his agility and motor to embarrass defenders and create open ice in the slot off-puck. Distracts defenders with flurries of fakes, pivots, and stick-handles to trick them into forgetting about his open linemate in the slot. Already an elite puck-battler on the wall and torments his opponents with an onslaught of stick-lifts and poke checks when they try to make a play with the puck, using his motor to chase all over the ice. Is still working out what he can get away with with the puck without turning it over and how to defend in the zone when full-tilt attack-the-carrier mode isn’t an option, but the skillset screams two-way superstar and offensively he’s not far off already."
Ty Dellandrea,San Jose Sharks,Forward,"A developing defensive winger who plays a gutsy physical game, attacking the puck with pace, throwing hits, and engaging opponents along the boards. Despite flashes of skill he’s mostly been limited to a dump-and-chase crash-the-net game with limited opportunities to create offence."
William Eklund,San Jose Sharks,Forward,"A developing playmaking winger who has shown flashes of high-end upside when it comes to distributing the puck. Rarely shoots the puck and scores even less at 5-on-5, but was the Sharks’ premier sniper on the powerplay as a rookie, scoring from one-timers in the right circle and crashing the net for rebounds, suggesting that his one-dimensional game has room for growth. Lack of size and speed may limit his upside, but he at least showed a willingness to engage in battles for the puck."
Barclay Goodrow,San Jose Sharks,Forward,"A depth checking winger whose game has simplified and diminished in the past several seasons. At one point a superb forechecker and strong defender, now relatively slow and uninvolved in battling for pucks and pressuring opponents with the puck while one of the least involved players in the league offensively. Can finish checks and drop the gloves."
Philipp Kurashev,San Jose Sharks,Forward,"A complementary forward who moves well and flashes creative playmaking ability. Not a play-driver by any means and shouldn’t be expected to create many opportunities for himself, but has upside as a passer and uses quick feet to pitch in off the rush. Provides limited bottom-six value due to his poor defensive impact."
Tyler Toffoli,San Jose Sharks,Forward,"A veteran scoring winger who, despite poor footspeed, is one of the league’s premier attackers off the rush. While other elements of his relatively complementary game can vary depending on his surroundings, what you can also count on is a volume of pucks on goal, especially from the outer slot. Toffoli’s smarts and instinct for the game allow him to get open for cross-ice feeds, sneak behind defences, and find soft areas where the puck always seems to get to him. Other aspects of his skillset are less exceptional, but he does make the simple continuation plays that don’t catch the eye but add up over time. You’ll rarely find him engaging physically on the forecheck or stealing pucks, but with the right linemates his style leads to lots of possession time and plenty of goals."
Alex Wennberg,San Jose Sharks,Forward,"A defensive playmaking centre who plays a stable, low-risk and relatively low-reward game. In the right role, can be an impressive and well-rounded passer, but has recently diminished in terms of creating opportunities for his linemates and producing at even strength. Extremely resistant to shooting the puck at 5-on-5 from anywhere on the ice. Despite limited offence, shows flashes of skill with great hands. Disciplined with the puck, rarely turning it over while having a strong defensive stick himself."
Mario Ferraro,San Jose Sharks,Defence,"A defence-first two-way defender with strong skating ability who plays a conservative game that involves very little involvement with the puck aside from putting low-percentage point shots on net. Mostly stays around the front of the net defensively, battling for position rather than chasing pucks and making plays with the puck in transition. Despite being small for a defenceman, not afraid to get involved physically."
Timothy Liljegren,San Jose Sharks,Defence,
Dmitry Orlov,San Jose Sharks,Defence,
Jan Rutta,San Jose Sharks,Defence,A stay-at-home depth defenceman with mobility and physicality but extremely limited puck skills and a habit for turning the puck over when forced to make a play. Puts pucks on net from the point with a decent shot but otherwise not a noteworthy offensive player.
Matty Beniers,Seattle Kraken,Forward,"A developing two-way playmaking centre still working out how to assert himself offensively. On offence, looks to pass first despite having a strong shot. Much of his creation originates in the defensive zone, where he ranks among the most active players in his age group in retrieving or stealing pucks and starting the rush from his own end of the ice. From there, he carries it through the neutral zone, often navigating around defenders before dishing a pass to an open linemate with speed. This skillset has made him an extremely effective defensive player, but until he’s more of a threat to score himself it limits his own offensive effectiveness."
Kaapo Kakko,Seattle Kraken,Forward,"A developing utility winger who protects the puck and contributes on the forecheck. While he’s shown flashes of the offensive upside he was drafted for, he has never developed the on-ice awareness to control the game offensively and still has too much tunnel vision with the puck on his stick to be much of a distributor unless the option is right in front of him. Lacks food speed and while he’s strong on the puck he’s not particularly physical either. His lack of progress in these areas makes it difficult to evision his upside as anything better than the third wheel retriever and net-crasher on a middle six unit."
Jared McCann,Seattle Kraken,Forward,"An efficient scoring centre who puts the puck in the net with sparkling efficiency. While he does have a great shot, the key to his gravity-defying finishing is that he strikes on high-percentage plays further out from the net like one-timers or screened shots from the outer slot or the perimeter, getting the goalie moving and opening up space to pick corners. Apart from his shot he’s a well-rounded if unexceptional two-way player who plays a clean game, shying away from physicality but drawing a lot of penalties."
Jaden Schwartz,Seattle Kraken,Forward,"A veteran playmaking two-way winger who uses his relatively short but sturdy frame to gain inside position in the slot and battle for pucks. Injuries and age have reduced his footspeed and made him more of a pure passer, and at this point he’s more of a utility piece to maintain possession than a line-driver. While he can still get to dangerous areas of the ice his finishing touch on those shots is poor and he struggles to put the puck in the net at 5-on-5."
Chandler Stephenson,Seattle Kraken,Forward,"A veteran playmaking centre whose game revolves around foot speed, carrying the puck through the neutral zone, and cycling the puck high in the offensive zone with a talented running mate. Shoots the puck very infrequently, and practically only off a pass and with lots of time and space. Undeniable passing upside but more dependent on his linemates than vise versa. Recently one of the fastest players in the league, but losing a step with each passing year. An unexceptional defender who doesn’t take penalties more due to a lack of physical engagement than strong discipline."
Eeli Tolvanen,Seattle Kraken,Forward,"A scoring winger whose game primarily revolves around puck-retrievals, pressuring and body-checking defencemen, and shooting and scoring off of extended offensive zone possessions. Has found a defensive niche even if his puck skills are much more limited than projected as a prospect."
Vince Dunn,Seattle Kraken,Defence,"A top-pairing offensive defenceman who moves the puck well in transition, controls play off the cycle, and puts the puck in the net at a strong rate. Has the creativity to set up linemates from the centre lane, venture towards the net to create chances for himself, and send pucks through to the net for deflections and rebounds. Deceptive in the neutral zone and clever at targeting linemates moving through the middle of the ice with speed to set up rush opportunities. A solid defensive stick and retrieves pucks in his own zone, but little physicality and can be weak in the net-front."
Brandon Montour,Seattle Kraken,Defence,"A smooth-skating second-pairing offensive defenceman who loves to join the rush, receive break-out passes and carry the puck into the offensive zone, and take it to the net for chances himself. Has a heavy slap-shot from the point but isn’t afraid to play like a fourth forward and take risks to shoot it from more dangerous areas of the ice. Some passing skill, but it’s not a significant strength of his game. Not particularly active in the defensive zone and prefers to be the beneficiary of a puck recovery and break-out pass than the initiator. His skillset can be maximized in a setting where he’s in the offensive zone as often as possible and doesn’t have to do the hard work defensively."
Adam Larsson,Seattle Kraken,Defence,"A stay-at-home defenceman who plays a conservative game with and without the puck with the exception of at times pushing further into the offensive zone to shoot the puck. Generally makes the safe play in transition. Protects the middle of the ice defensively off the rush and in sustained possessions rather than aggressively seeking to disrupt plays or chase loose pucks along the boards. As a result, needs a partner who’s willing and able to do the leg work to push play back in the right direction."
Jamie Oleksiak,Seattle Kraken,Defence,"A big veteran two-way defenceman who despite being one of the tallest and heaviest players in the league is a strong skater and plays with solid pace all over the ice. Limited as a puck-mover in transition and prone to turnovers, but an ambitious offensive-zone passer surprisingly adept at setting up linemates in dangerous areas of the ice. Has a bomb of a slap shot but rarely uses it, and picks his spots to jump up in the play and go to the net himself. Uses his massive stick and mobility in the defensive zone, disrupting plays along the boards, suppressing rush opportunities, and recovering loose pucks to turn into zone exits at a prolific and efficient clip. Doesn’t typically use his size to punish opponents physically but when he does (either in checks or fights) it can be deadly."
Pavel Buchnevich,St. Louis Blues,Forward,"A well-rounded top-line two-way forward who moves the puck up-ice in transition. An adaptable play-driver who matches his skill with the puck with an ability to fill in the blanks and provide value on any type of line. A pass-first player but gets to the net and has a knack for providing a target for cross-seam passes and deflections with nice finishing touch in tight; aside from when he takes a little extra time to deke around a goalie on the backhand, you almost never see him score of a non-one-timed or deflected shot. Improbably, the same is true of his playmaking: he wastes no time whatsoever with the puck, making quick, snappy passes often within a second of getting to the puck which allows him to advance it in transition and set up breakaways and shred the slot with speedy feeds after forechecking retrievals. These transition plays combined with strong possession have helped make him a terrific defensive player and a deadly penalty killer as well."
Dylan Holloway,St. Louis Blues,Forward,"A developing physical shot-first winger who battles for pucks like his life depends on it but doesn’t quite know what to do once he’s got it. He has solid hands and can gain the offensive zone, but what comes after that has often been elusive. His speed would suggest upside as a rush scorer, and there have been flashes in that direction that would help him fill a Josh Anderson role. Conversely, he seems to be a complete non-factor of a playmaker, lacking the ability to move the puck to dangerous areas and deferring entirely to safe low-high passes."
Mathieu Joseph,St. Louis Blues,Forward,"A speedy defensive middle six utility winger and penalty killer. Flashes offensive talent as a rusher, where he helps recover the puck in the defensive zone and move it up the ice either by carrying it or making short passes. From there he often makes simple but effective feeds, as his own shot is not particularly accurate. Provides defensive value through forechecking, physicality, and puck retrieval, although he gives some of it back through frequent turnovers, especially when he tries to do too much with it."
Jordan Kyrou,St. Louis Blues,Forward,"An offensive top-line winger with exceptional puck skills and the ability to pose a significant threat both as a passer and a shooter. Combines breakaway speed, superb hands, creativity, and a slick shot to be one of the better offensive weapons in the league when he’s at his best. Carries the puck through the neutral zone more than almost anyone, and how effective he is often depends on whether he’s able to turn those transitional plays into scoring chances. Even when he isn’t the one possessing the puck entering the zone, he makes himself a terrific target for west-to-east passes by gunning to the net with speed and catching defenders distracted. Uses his feet to draw defenders out of position before snapping passes to the slot from the wing or behind the net, and loves give-and-go plays off the rush. Figuring out how to make his game less high-risk, with fewer turnovers and lengthier offensive zone sequences a positive development."
Jake Neighbours,St. Louis Blues,Forward,"A developing scoring winger who put the puck in the net with great efficiency, slotting in with talented linemates and finding soft areas of the ice to generate one-timers and deflections. Throws the body and battles for pucks at both ends, although despite his enthusiasm his size makes it tough for him to win those spars. Will need to expand his game to continue to succeed in this role, as any reduction to his finishing rate would expose the limitations of his game with the puck as it stands now."
Robert Thomas,St. Louis Blues,Forward,"A skilled top-line playmaking centre who has established himself as one of the league’s best and most prolific passers. Plays the game with patience and deliberation, and even though he’s a premier rush player and often gets breakaways he doesn’t skate quickly; there’s almost a leisurely pace to how he moves with the puck. Always scanning and mapping out the offensive zone, he has the vision to identify the best passing target on the ice before the puck is even on his stick (often catching opposing defenders stunned with a no-look tape to tape pass) and the execution to deliver the “obvious” pass into the slot through stick and limbs. Few move the puck from “safe” areas like behind the net to high-danger areas nearly as well. An increasingly efficient finisher with a sneaky wrist shot who doesn’t shoot the puck unless he absolutely has to and especially refuses to put it on net from the perimeter at 5v5. Increasingly trusted defensively, but while he’s got a good stick and has become a good faceoff taker his chance suppression at evens has generally been poor, probably due in large part to how he plays offence."
Brayden Schenn,St. Louis Blues,Forward,"A veteran offensive centre who plays a complementary role at this point of his career. Has a solid and versatile shot with the ability to score from distance, and likes to blow the zone early to chase the odd-man counter-attack. Plays with a physical edge and forces the play, but the high-risk style has evident downsides and the Blues give up plenty with him on the ice. With the right linemates he can provide value as a passer but it seems unlikely that he could still drive a top six line."
Pius Suter,St. Louis Blues,Forward,"A middle-six shut-down centre who overcomes extremely poor skating, small size, and unexceptional puck skills with a strong defensive stick, smarts, scoring touch, and a willingness to get to the front of the net. Positions himself in the slot and keeps his stick free for linemates to target, throwing one-timers and rebounds on net. An asset defensively at even strength and the penalty kill despite being spotty in the dot due to strong positioning and a good stick."
Justin Faulk,St. Louis Blues,Defence,"A veteran offensive defenceman who takes risks all over the ice, with mixed results. Eager to jump into the rush and uses his stocky frame to protect the puck when it’s on his stick. Distributes the puck in the offensive zone, often getting into the centre lane and feeding wingers for scoring chances. Has a hard and heavy shot that he uses enthusiastically, but has no issue carrying the puck closer to the net before releasing it. Without the puck, tries to disrupt plays aggressively which results in a lot of takeaways but even more instances where he ends up blown past or chasing while the puck swings into the slot."
Colton Parayko,St. Louis Blues,Defence,"A big-minute top pair defensive defenceman blessed with exceptional physical gifts including massive size and reach and shockingly blazing footspeed. Absorbs difficult minutes, using his long stick to close off passing lanes in tight and his mobility to recover loose pucks, although he does often have trouble gathering them without allowing time for forecheckers to put them back in play. As with many blueliners of his height, not a prolific hitter. One of the most prolific puck-carrying defencemen in the league who mostly eschews break-out passes for doing the work of navigating the neutral zone himself, building up speed to gain the zone. Once in the offensive zone his game becomes much simpler, using a punishing slap-shot from the point or drifting to the circles to whip a wrist shot. While his defensive presence is stabilizing, the more puck-dominant aspects of his game can tend to keep it out of the hands of more dynamic forwards in transition, with consequences when it comes to overall team offence with him on the ice."
Nick Leddy,St. Louis Blues,Defence,"A swift-footed transition defenceman who uses his mobility to transport the puck up the ice either through breakout passes or on his stick. Capable of jumping up in the zone to distribute the puck to dangerous areas but isn’t a difference-maker offensively and rarely shoots. Plays a soft gap defending the rush, allowing opponents to gain the zone but protecting the middle of the ice. Struggles once set up in the defensive zone, rarely separating opponents from the puck."
Ryan Suter,St. Louis Blues,Defence,"A veteran defensive defenceman who plays a conservative game. Extremely and increasingly limited mobility prevents him from making ambitious plays, and if the play gets behind him things can go badly very quickly. Although he has a reasonably strong breakout pass he is fairly turnover prone relative to his infrequent puck touches. Doesn’t defend the blueline aggressively but sags back to direct traffic towards the boards and limit chances. Doesn’t do much in the offensive zone but set his partner up for one-timers."
Cam Fowler,St. Louis Blues,Defence,"A veteran two-way puck-moving defenceman, durable enough to withstand significant and difficult minutes while avoiding injury. Offers a stable if unexceptional skillset, moving the puck in transition and distributing it in the offensive zone with crisp, accurate passes that rarely result in turnovers. Reasonably active in the defensive zone with solid positioning, but does have a tendency to get walked when facing rushing attackers. Would likely be better-suited to a second-pairing role."
Oliver Bjorkstrand,Tampa Bay Lightning,Forward,"A two-way scoring winger who carries the puck in transition and plays a shot-first game in the offensive zone at even strength while dishing it on the powerplay. Works hard without the puck to regain it, chasing down loose pucks all over the ice and using a savvy defensive stick to separate opponents and work on the counter-attack. Despite a lack of size and foot speed, protects the puck well and controls possession well."
Anthony Cirelli,Tampa Bay Lightning,Forward,A high-end shut-down centre capable of winning shifts against top competition
Yanni Gourde,Tampa Bay Lightning,Forward,"A two-way playmaking centre who crashes the net and plays an active game with and without the puck. Harrasses opponents with stick checks, board battles, forechecking, and even hits despite being only 5’9. Light on his feet and manages the puck well, playing a straightforward transition game. A prolific passer, especially off extended offensive zone possessions where he often plays behind the net and extends his team’s cycling sequences by protecting the puck and making low-to-high passes. Once the puck gets to the point, he’s excellent at getting a stick on point shots. While he doesn’t create a high volume of shots for himself, the ones he does get are often in the blue point; unfortunately, his finishing touch is sub-par."
Jake Guentzel,Tampa Bay Lightning,Forward,"A star offensive winger who does everything necessary to make talented linemates better. Easy to play with because of his intelligence off the puck, willingness to go to the dangerous areas of the ice, strong finishing touch, and well-rounded offensive ability. Especially effective on lengthy cycling sequences where he is adept at getting defenders to lose sight of him until it’s too late and the puck’s on his stick in tight. Piles up scoring chances near the net including the inner slot, finding soft space near the back door and winning position in tight despite being relatively small and light. Particularly strong on deflections and gets to rebounds quick and cleanly, making him a great net-front option on the powerplay. Well above-average in almost all areas of the game including passing, but doesn’t need to spend a ton of time with the puck to make a big impact. Not very physical or abundantly fast but has a high motor nonetheless that makes him an effective and committed forechecker."
Brandon Hagel,Tampa Bay Lightning,Forward,"A top line two-way winger who tilts the ice at an elite level with a well-rounded set of skills at both ends of the ice. Well above-average in practically every area of the game, combining foot-speed, pace, motor, determination, creativity, and skill. Creates piles of breakaway and rush opportunities, bolting up the ice to receive break-out passes and catch defenders on the back-foot, and has the hands to beat them even when they do seem to have him cut off. Crashes the net at almost reckless speeds, taking plenty of damage in the interest of getting to loose pucks, rebounds, and back-door passes first. As easy as it is to envision this type of player having tunnel vision and always thinking shot-first, he thinks the game as quickly as he moves, allowing him to identify and execute split-second passing plays and one-touch sequences and spring linemates for breakaways, often with tape-to-tape saucer passes. Add in his active stick, forechecking motor, and willingness to battle for the puck and it’s tough to find a weak area of his game unless you’re fixated on bodychecking."
Nikita Kucherov,Tampa Bay Lightning,Forward,"A superstar playmaking winger with generational passing ability from the wing. Makes difficult passing plays look completely effortless, controlling the game at 5-on-5 like a powerplay and moving the puck at a serene pace. Sees plays develop in slow motion and makes lightning-fast decisions, taking pucks from the wall and perimeter and sending them to the slot in one smooth motion. Maybe the best player in the league at executing one-touch passing sequences and give-and-go plays. Uses his solid foot speed and excellent hands to bait defenders before casually dishing maddening feeds to an open linemate at just the right time. A superb goal-scorer with a silky smooth release.  Effective in transition not only as the primary puck carrier but as a passer who constantly improves the condition of the puck with one-touch passes to streaking linemates in the neutral zone. The occasional bit of nastiness doesn’t translate to consistent physical presence and while he’s not a liability defensively, other than takeaways, zone exits, and strong puck management he’s not exactly a shut-down winger."
Brayden Point,Tampa Bay Lightning,Forward,"A star scoring centre whose elite speed, puck skills, and nose for the net have allowed him to  become one of the game’s most consistent and efficient producers.  Times his routes to the back door extremely well, making him an ideal target for high-danger passes. Has a pin-point accurate one-timer but the presence of mind to take that extra second or even handle the puck in tight to make sure the net is as empty as possible before he shoots it, a quality that has made him the most efficient shooter in the game throughout his prime. A deft puck-handler whose speed and creativity through the neutral zone allow him to back off defenders, create odd-man breaks, and open passing lanes. Shot-first on extended offensive zone possessions but pass-first in transition.  Selects passes as carefully as he selects shots, making him one of the more careful puck managers in the league. Aside from asserting his presence in the slot lacks physicality due to his slight size  and has allowed his previously-strong defensive impact to slip in recent seasons."
Victor Hedman,Tampa Bay Lightning,Defence,
Ryan McDonagh,Tampa Bay Lightning,Defence,
Max Domi,Toronto Maple Leafs,Forward,"A pure playmaking forward who plays with an edge between the whistles. Can play centre or wing. Provides the vast majority of his value by funneling pucks from the perimeter to the slot, and while his passing lacks the finesse of other similar players the feeds get where they need to go. Not a threat to shoot the puck (except off the rush, where his solid foot speed makes him reasonably dangerous) or the occasional net-crashed rebound, and finishes inefficiently as well. Expresses his nastiness not by throwing hits, battling for pucks along the wall, or forechecking but by taking minor penalties of choice — lots of cross-checks, roughings, and slashes. Willing to drop the gloves to back up this behaviour."
Matthew Knies,Toronto Maple Leafs,Forward,"A developing power forward whose game is already extremely well-suited to complement talented linemates. Leverages his big and sturdy 6”3 227 point frame to battle on the boards, finish checks, and exert pressure on opposing defencemen trying to move the puck. That size also comes in handy in front of the net, where he wins position, sets screens, and jumps on rebounds. Boasts terrific hand-eye coordination and has a knack for getting a stick on point shots. Gets to the right place at the right time to smack in a high-danger pass but can also beat goalies clean from mid-range or on breakaways. Limited playmaking and creativity as a transition player will likely cap his ability to drive his own line but should be a real asset throughout his prime."
Auston Matthews,Toronto Maple Leafs,Forward,"A superstar scoring centre with generational ability to create chances and put the puck into the net, especially at even strength. Combines an unmatched release with elite hockey IQ, strength, and soft hands to be a singular threat off the puck. Exploits gaps in coverage, timing routes through traffic in the slot, and takes full advantage of the fact that he requires almost no time to get off a shot that can beat goaltenders point blank. Turns heavy pass receptions into wrist shots in one motion with unparalleled fluidity, meaning he needs only a second or two of space. Equally dangerous from distance, where he threatens with his trademark drag wrist shot, a thunderous onetimer, and tricky surprise strikes from the wall, as he is from the inner slot. Despite not being an end-to-end transition puck carrier, his control with it on his blade is astonishing and he’s one of the best in the world at taking pucks from awkward spots to scoring position, often with a slick deke around a helpless defender or goalie betwen his own legs. This extends to pucks on the stick of his opponents, which he strips on the forecheck with maddening frequency; meanwhile, you rarely see him cough up a puck himself. It helps when he also leverages his heavy 6”3 frame to win battles along the boards. Will never be mistaken for a pass-first player but is well above-average at creating for his linemates as well. The only issue with him has been health, with concerns always present about the possibility that his injury history will compound and damage his elite skills."
Bobby McMann,Toronto Maple Leafs,Forward,"A speedy middle-six scoring winger with a high motor. An enthusiastic forechecker who uses quick feet to harrass defenders and force turnovers. Effective in front of the net as a screener and gets plenty of deflections. Puts lots of pucks on net from all over the ice, and justifies it with a great release. Lacks the puck skills to be more of a difference-maker offensively but easy to move around the lineup."
William Nylander,Toronto Maple Leafs,Forward,"A star winger with an enviable set of offensive tools. Has the ability to score in practically any way,  whether it’s accurate wrist shots from distance, cross-ice one-timers, slick dekes around the goalie, or ugly net-crashing plays. His trademark goal is a wrister from just above the hashmarks between the dots, sometimes on a breakaway and sometimes on an offensive zone sequences where he’s burst off the wall to get the puck to the middle. Creates lots of room for himself in transition and despite only average foot-speed generates a lot of breakaways and odd-man opportunities. In addition to his elite hands, the 20 pounds he added since his rookie season make him hard to knock off the puck and give him that extra gear to beat defenders and take the puck end to end. A high-I.Q. playmaker who uses his feet, hands, fakes, and patience to force defenders out of passing lanes and wait for his target to get to the back door. Does everything offensively with a ton of style. While he has added size and some more grit to his offensive game, it has never translated to his play without the puck which is disinterested at best and lacks any physical engagement."
John Tavares,Toronto Maple Leafs,Forward,"A veteran top six scoring centre who excels in the tough areas of the ice in front of the net and along the boards. Solidly built and hard to knock off the puck, wins battles all over the ice and creates tons of opportunities in the blue paint. While the bulk of his chances come from in tight, he’s got a shot that can beat goalies from the flank or the top of the slot and is clever enough to hide on the perimeter before darting to open ice to receive a pass. Never the league’s most graceful or agile skater but can build up a decent amount of straight-line speed to win races and create breakaways and odd-man rushes. A deceptive puck-handler who can navigate through traffic and execute no-look passes out of dekes, although he generally looks to make the less-risky possession-extending feed to the point."
Brandon Carlo,Toronto Maple Leafs,Defence,"A top four defensive defenceman. Offensive game is effectively limited to being strong on the puck and occasionally carrying it in transition, although you will never see him trying to deke out an opponent. In his own end, he uses his huge frame not to throw crushing hits but to clear the front of the net, battle for pucks along the boards, block passing lanes and force turnovers, and to recover loose pucks. These skills make him an elite penalty killer as well."
Morgan Rielly,Toronto Maple Leafs,Defence,
Chris Tanev,Toronto Maple Leafs,Defence,
Logan Cooley,Utah Mammoth,Forward,"A developing playmaking centre with dynamic skill with the puck off the rush. Plays an up-tempo, eye-catching game, excelling at entering the zone with speed and control and creating legitimate scoring opportunities in transition. Frequently makes opposing defenders look silly or leaves them sprawled on the ice after a barrage of head-fakes, stick-handles, and pivots before navigating around them and taking a slick wrist shot or dishing a high-danger pass to the back-door. Scans the ice as quickly as he skates, identifying trailer options instead of always forcing the most difficult play. While he lacks size, he’s not afraid to play through contact and get to the net, although you’re more likely to see him lurking around the high slot than standing in the blue paint. Has tried to add a bit of edge to his game but it’s difficult at his size and his defensive game is mostly limited to forcing turnovers with an eye to getting the rush game back on track."
Lawson Crouse,Utah Mammoth,Forward,"A physical middle six winger who throws his weight around, gets to the front of the net, and occasionally gets off a heavy one-timer. Moves quite well, if not always gracefully, and lets linemates do most of the work with the puck in favour of crashing the crease or getting to the circles to receive a feed. Occasionally flashes some of the puck skill that made him a promising power forward as a prospect but his game is generally pretty straightforward."
Dylan Guenther,Utah Mammoth,Forward,"A developing scoring winger who torments goalies with a hard and accurate shot that can beat them from distance. His trademark is a pin-point left-circle one-timer but he’s got a lethal wrister as well which he’s able to get off in transition thanks to great wheels and increasing confidence handling the puck. Regarded as an off-puck scorer as a prospect, he’s clever at finding soft areas in the offensive zone, especially on cycling sequences where he can get lost in that medium-range area where he can reliably put the puck in the net, but at the NHL level he’s actually become much more puck-dominant. An unremarkable defender but a willing participant in his team’s end-to-end rush-based attack."
Clayton Keller,Utah Mammoth,Forward,"A first line playmaking winger whose patience with the puck and control of the perimeter makes him a significant offensive threat. Since he’s small and one of the least physical players in the NHL, he focuses on owning the half wall and taking advantage of where he’s guaranteed plenty of space to work so he can send passes to his linemates occupying the middle of the ice and the opposite flanks. Will take the puck from the wall to the top of the slot himself if he has space to do so relatively uncontested, although that mostly comes on the powerplay. Understands the value of getting the goalie moving even when the shots are coming from outside the slot and loves to make a long-distance east-to-west pass across the offensive zone. A significant scoring threat himself, especially from the dots on the powerplay where his one-timer is hard and accurate and he can take advantage of the extra space to whistle wrist shots over the shoulder of goalies. A terrific transition player who uses agility and hands to traverse the neutral zone and get the puck to his linemates off entries. Given his complete lack of physicality, his defensive impact is limited to a decent stick and transporting pucks out of his own end."
Jack McBain,Utah Mammoth,Forward,A physical bottom six centre who finishes his checks and parks his large frame at the net-front. Flashes solid hands in tight on occasion and can transition the puck out of the defensive zone but doesn’t create at a consistent enough clip to project further up the lineup. Makes his presence felt on the forecheck but also takes too many penalties as a result.
JJ Peterka,Utah Mammoth,Forward,"A developing scoring winger with a wicked wrist shot that can beat goalies cleanly, especially off the rush. Doesn’t need a lot of time or space to pick his spots, but creates extra room for himself with excellent hands. Doesn’t sit in the slot but times entries to receive high-danger passes. Quick feet and awareness lead to frequent breakaways and odd-man rushes. Not a difference-maker defensively, rarely forcing turnovers or retrieving pucks in his own zone and quite turnover prone."
Nick Schmaltz,Utah Mammoth,Forward,"A top-six playmaking forward who can play right wing or centre and generates a ton of opportunities for his linemates. Despite a lack of size and physicality and average at best footspeed, his vision and soft hands make him a reliable transition driver and a deadly puck-mover in the offensive zone who can take the extra time with the puck on his stick to open up a lane to the slot. Great at taking the puck off the wall and transporting it to the middle of the ice at the right time. Not a volume shooter by any stretch but finds soft spots in the slot to strike. Not a defensive liability and is engaged in his own end winning pucks and starting the break-out, although he can be a bit turn-over prone in the process."
Mikhail Sergachev,Utah Mammoth,Defence,"A top-pairing offensive defenceman who can handle heavy match-up minutes. Effective in the offensive zone, where he’s confident with the puck and willing to jump up in the play and get in tight to create scoring chances. A solid passer and strong carrying the puck but not a stand-out transition driver. An aggressive defender with an effective stick that disrupts plays but has a habit for getting carried away and blown past off the rush when the effort goes awry or getting caught chasing the puck in the defensive zone and drawn out of position. Not a particularly physical player despite good size."
Sean Durzi,Utah Mammoth,Defence,
John Marino,Utah Mammoth,Defence,
Brock Boeser,Vancouver Canucks,Forward,
Filip Chytil,Vancouver Canucks,Forward,"A shoot-first middle-six two-way centre who carries the puck in transition with superb speed and great hands. A battler who gets to the grimy areas of the ice along the boards and especially in front of the net, where he’s willing to jump on rebounds and take abuse in the blue ice. Not an exceptional defender but mostly does his job, although his ambitious attempts to win loose pucks in his own end often go awry."
Jake DeBrusk,Vancouver Canucks,Forward,
Conor Garland,Vancouver Canucks,Forward,
Elias Pettersson,Vancouver Canucks,Forward,"A first-line centre who plays an elegant, efficient game. When unencumbered by injury, his whippy wrist shot release is one of the deadliest in the NHL, almost impossible for goalies to stop from medium range. Also has a superb one-timer from the right circle on the powerplay and the hands to guide the puck into the net through multiple defenders and the goalie. His reluctance to hit top speed and rangy build combine with the precision of his puck skills give him an effortless air as he glides around the offensive zone. A phenomenally gifted passer who sees the ice incredibly well, is a patient decision-maker and casually delivers beautiful passes to the back door. Uses his backhand well to move the puck low-to-high and tee up trailers or defencemen skating in from the point. Has never been a quantity chance creator but picks his spots carefully, prioritizing possession over forcing plays. Unfairly criticized for a lack of physicality as he’s not afraid to use his body to win pucks along the boards, finish checks, and play through contact at the net-front. However, his stick is no doubt his most effective defensive weapon."
Kiefer Sherwood,Vancouver Canucks,Forward,
Filip Hronek,Vancouver Canucks,Defence,
Quinn Hughes,Vancouver Canucks,Defence,"An elite two-way defenceman who combines smooth skating, incredible passing skill, and silky puck control to impact the game like few other blueliners in recent memory. No defenceman spends more time with the puck on his stick, and when it comes to him at the point the possibilities are endless. Walks the blueline effortlessly, spinning off checks and constantly faking passes, keeping wingers guessing and leaving them in the dust if he decides to drop the shoulder and drive down the wing. Initiates the cycle by darting to the right point and getting his linemates to shift in tandem. Becoming a legitimate shooting and scoring threat himself has only enhanced his overall offensive game and no defender is better at and more willing to go coast to coast. The combination of his agile skating, hands, and passing ability make him the most prolific break-out passer in the game, as they allow him to beat the forechecker and buy time to deliver the optimal feed out of the zone. Uses his back-hand surprisingly often in transition, a testament to the unconventional routes he takes and lanes he identifies. Likely the best long-distance passer in the game. Defensively inhibited by his lack of size and rarely throws a check or effectively uses his body to win a battle, including at the net-front where he struggles to maintain inside position and can be exploited by stronger opponents. Nonetheless, stays on the positive side of the defensive ledger through his skating, awareness, and disruptive stick and has the skill to turn stick checks into changes of possession and clean zone exits in a second."
Marcus Pettersson,Vancouver Canucks,Defence,
Pavel Dorofeyev,Vegas Golden Knights,Forward,
Jack Eichel,Vegas Golden Knights,Forward,"A dynamic star centre whose envious footspeed and puck skills make him one of the deadliest offensive players in the league and an often-formidable defender as well. Spends more time than almost anybody in the game with the puck on his stick, not only dominating as a transition player but circling the offensive zone as well. Can beat defenders through the neutral zone by blowing past them with speed, deking past them with his terrific hands, or weaponizing his strong frame to protect the puck and beating them to the outside. Wants to attack the slot off the rush but manages the puck well and is willing to stop up, buy time, and make the safe pass to maintain possession. Speed, motor, stick, and strength combine to make him a menace without the puck and he’s always eager to disrupt plays and start the rush so he can get back to the fun part. A crafty and patient passer who uses his skating to open up lanes and his stick checking to create feeds to the slot out of nothing. A deadly scorer on breakaways and one-timers but also willing to crash the net to put the puck in."
Tomas Hertl,Vegas Golden Knights,Forward,
Mitch Marner,Vegas Golden Knights,Forward,"A star playmaking winger who plays a skilled defensive game as well. There may be no player at his position better at transporting the puck from the perimeter to a linemate’s tape in the slot, whether he’s patiently circling behind the net and targeting a player in front, carrying up to the point before firing a feed diagonal to the back door, or manipulating passing lanes with his terrific hands off the rush. Navigates to the easy areas of the ice and rewards his linemates for getting to the tougher spots. Keeps his small and light frame away from the board and net-front battles, but nonetheless exerts a positive defensive impact through a smart stick, great positioning, and efficiency transporting the puck out of his own end. An underrated goal scorer with a nice finishing touch in tight who doesn’t shoot the puck particularly often, and generates quite a few breakaways relative to his below-average foot speed. When games tighten up can retreat into a pure passer, continuing to create chances for his linemates but nullifying himself as a shooting threat."
Brandon Saad,Vegas Golden Knights,Forward,"A veteran shoot-first scoring winger who’s transitioned to being more of a net-front mucker in the past few seasons. Pounces on rebounds and makes himself available for one-timers in the slot, generating most of his offence in transition with the associated defensive drawbacks that come from such an aggressive counter-attacking style. Much more likely to jump into the rush after a teammate has gotten out of the defensive zone than do the work to force the turnover himself. Still has some speed, which helps him get where he needs to go in those bang-bang plays."
Reilly Smith,Vegas Golden Knights,Forward,"A middle six scoring winger who plays on his off-side and does almost all his damage off the counter-attack. Frees up pucks in his own end and distributes them transition, freeing him up to find soft areas of coverage to get open for a one-timer or smooth wrist shot. By no means a fast skater but times his routes well and gets up and down the ice. Doesn’t strip pucks or throw hits himself, but is quick to adjust when a linemates does so to get into the right spot to receive a feed. A high-I.Q. playmaker who reads the ice well and can catch defencemen unaware with a clever no-look backhand pass or a well-timed saucer pass; that said, his ambition can get the best of him and he turns the puck over at a high rate."
Mark Stone,Vegas Golden Knights,Forward,"A veteran two-way playmaking winger with kleptomaniacal tendencies and an understanding of the game that transcends his sluggish foot-speed. Steals pucks by hounding opposing forwards using conventional stick checks and lifts and his solid frame but also loves to deploy his trademark kneeling stick-on-ice interception that catches pucks on the shaft of his stick. These steals are extra effective because Stone has the hands and strength to weave his way out of trouble right afterwards and the hockey I.Q. to know exactly what he wants to do with the puck before he has it. Almost the ideal linemate given his ability to process where everyone on the ice is, improve the condition of the puck with short passes, and reward teammates for winning races to open ice that he can’t. The master of the area pass through traffic to a streaking linemate in transition, a microcosm of his complementary transition game that begins with hard work in the defensive zone and continues through accurate build-up passes through the neutral zone. Not likely to take the puck end to end, create tons of shots for himself, throw the body or chase pucks into the corners, but tilts the ice at a high level even as his skating continues to decline."
Noah Hanifin,Vegas Golden Knights,Defence,
Brayden McNabb,Vegas Golden Knights,Defence,
Shea Theodore,Vegas Golden Knights,Defence,"A top-pairing puck-moving offensive defenceman whose ability to advance the puck in transition is almost unrivalled. Relishes any opportunity to deke past an opposing forward, whether it’s when trying to break-out the puck or at the top of the offensive zone, and can gain a ton of space by dummying a winger and pushing off with his quick acceleration. This one-on-one skill extends to the defensive side of his game, where he’s most effective when locked in a man-to-man battle off the rush, racing to a loose puck, or disrupting plays early. His signature skill is his passing, which he shows off with breakaway-springing stretch passes and clever feeds from the neutral zone through sticks to a rushing teammate. Less often he leads the rush himself but he’s great at that too. Despite his defensive skills, he can get himself caught up-ice or out of position and his near-total lack of physicality leads to him losing inside position at the net-front."
Pierre-Luc Dubois,Washington Capitals,Forward,
Connor McMichael,Washington Capitals,Forward,
Aliaksei Protas,Washington Capitals,Forward,
Alex Ovechkin,Washington Capitals,Forward,"A veteran scoring winger who can still put the puck in the net with age-defying frequency. When he’s on his game, he’s still a scoring chance machine who puts pucks on net from absolutely everywhere, including the dirty areas in front of the net. His gravity as a scorer also gives him openings to send fake-shot-passes to linemates in the slot and generate lots of rebounds for linemates to jump on. When he’s not feeling it he can get stuck playing stationary perimeter hockey waiting for one-time passes. Lets his linemates do most of the work with and without the puck, as he’s now one of the slowest skaters in the league and has rarely been a particularly engaged defensive player. However just because he doesn’t carry the puck doesn’t make him a poor rush player; he’s the ideal trailer, letting his linemates play give-and-go while he hangs back and waits to receive the puck with enough space to snap it in. He may not be chasing pucks or working the wall but he still takes every opportunity to use his 238 pound frame to lay crushing hits."

John Carlson,Washington Capitals,Defence,
Jakob Chychrun,Washington Capitals,Defence,
Rasmus Sandin,Washington Capitals,Defence,
Kyle Connor,Winnipeg Jets,Forward,"A star scoring winger with a large toolkit of skills dedicated to putting pucks in the back of the net. His shot is deadly from mid-range when he has the space to wind it up, and his good feet and terrific hands help him create that space, especially in transition where he’s a major threat. Because he can score from distance, beat defenders and goalies one-on-one, and outskate most players in the league, he’s a pain in the ass to defend against when he has the puck off the rush. Embarrasses goalies on frequent breakaways. Can be a phantom in the offensive zone, sneaking around the middle of ice and somehow avoiding being noticed by any defenders until it’s too late and the puck’s already off his stick and past the goalie. Without the puck, takes risks and blows the zone as early as possible to increase the chance of creating a counter-attack or getting a breakaway, and has had significant defensive issues throughout his career as a result. Almost never hits and generally stays out of the tough areas in the corners in favour of finding soft spots in coverage for the puck to come to him."
Adam Lowry,Winnipeg Jets,Forward,
Nino Niederreiter,Winnipeg Jets,Forward,
Mark Scheifele,Winnipeg Jets,Forward,"A star playmaking centre who plays a patient, high-I.Q. offensive game that creates plenty of grade-A opportunities for his linemates. Sees the ice very well and understands how the play will develop, with the size and hands to hold onto the puck for the extra moment of time that will open a passing lane. Very good at protecting the puck behind the net while waiting for his linemate to get open in the slot, and generally controls the game at a high level from low in the zone, keeping options open to swing pucks to his wingers or the point. Exploits the fact that he’s a major threat to score himself to force defencemen to gamble and takes advantage when they guess wrong. An opportunistic scorer who doesn’t take a large quantity of shots, especially from the outside, but jumps on loose pucks in tight and makes himself available for passes to the slot. An efficient transition player with a knack for turning entries into scoring chances. Defensive deficiencies are as consistent as they are surprising given his hockey I.Q., but he’s frequently late getting back and gets lost in the defensive zone far too often."
Cole Perfetti,Winnipeg Jets,Forward,
Gabe Vilardi,Winnipeg Jets,Forward,
Josh Morrissey,Winnipeg Jets,Defence,"An elite two-way defenceman with a silky smooth skating stride and high-end puck-moving ability. Ever since being given the green light to play a more adventurous style a few seasons ago has flourished at creating offence, jumping up along the boards, joining or even leading the rush, forcing turnovers in the offensive zone, and using his graceful feet to create space that he’s adept at exploiting. A superb passer, one of the premier creators of scoring chances for his linemates among blueliners. Excels when there’s open ice available, especially in 3-on-3 overtime where he can play truly positionless hockey. The key is execution; he doesn’t have the same strenuous workload with the puck as some other top producers but makes the most of each possession and is excellent at avoiding turnovers. Small for a defenceman and rarely throws hits or decisively wins a net-front battle, but an extremely precise and efficient puck retriever in the defensive zone who takes pucks off the wall and exits the zone very well."
